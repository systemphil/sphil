Welcome to the sPhil repository. We're happy you're here and would like to
contribute to the project! We hope this guide will get you up to speed with the
workings of the web application and help you set up your own local development.

## Overview

## üßë‚Äçüíª Local Development

The web app requires a number of API keys to function properly. However, not all
these are required for most development. If you'd like to gain access to our
shared development environment, please get in touch service@systemphil.com or
[join our discord](https://discord.gg/2T4mPCCYhu) with an introduction of
yourself.

The remainder of this guide assumes you want to set up your own development
environment.

After you have forked and cloned the repository to your machine, begin by
creating a `.env` in the project root. Observe `.env.example` for a list of key
names and copy over at least the minimal set.

### Minimal Environment

Minimal environment will require these env vars:

-   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_ROOT` Copy this from `env.example`
-   `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` Copy this from `env.example`
-   `DATABASE_URL`
-   `AUTH_SECRET`
-   `AUTH_GITHUB_ID`
-   `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET`
-   `GCP_PRIMARY_BUCKET_NAME`
-   `GCP_SECONDARY_BUCKET_NAME`
-   `GCP_BUCKET_HANDLER_KEY`
-   `STRIPE_API_KEY`

Note: without Stripe access, you won't be able to create or fully update
courses.

#### üê± Git prerequisites

1. Once you have access to the repo on github, fork and/or clone it into a
   folder where you keep your projects.
1. Then `cd sphil` to get into the project directory.
1. Make your own development branch `git checkout -b dev-<your-name>` (example:
   `git checkout -b dev-tim`).
1. In future, when getting the latest changes from the main development branch,
   run `git merge main` whilst on your development branch to incorporate the
   changes into your branch.

#### üíæ Packages Installation

1. Once inside, run `npm i` (alias `npm install`) to install all the packages.
   This will create the `/node_modules` folder.

#### üóÉÔ∏è Setting up a database instance for local development (cockroachdb)

You can either [sign up on cockroachdb](https://www.cockroachlabs.com) to get a
serverless instance on the free tier or set up one locally.

1. To download and install cockroachdb locally, follow these guides for your
   system:
    - [Download latest stable production release](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/articles/releases)
    - [Installation instructions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/articles/v24.2/install-cockroachdb)
2. Verify installation was successful, running `cockroach demo` and inputting
   `SELECT ST_IsValid(ST_MakePoint(1,2));` into the interactive shell.
3. In a new terminal, start a single-node local instance (commands for Windows
   may vary). Make sure to input your user home directory.
    - ```sh
      cockroach start-single-node --insecure \
      --listen-addr=localhost:26257 \
      --http-addr=localhost:8080 \
      --store=path=/home/YOUR_USER/cockroach-data,size=2GB
      ```
4. From the standard output, make sure to extract and save the `sql:` path for
   the `DATABASE_URL` for the `.env`. It starts with `postgresql://`.
5. With the db instance running, you can check if Prisma is able to connect with
   it and migrate its schemas. Run `npx prisma db push`.

#### üîê Authentication setup

1. `AUTH_SECRET` can be any random string. You can use `openssl rand -base64 32`
   to generate one.
2. For the Github credentials, begin by going to
   [github developer settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
3. Create a new OAuth app
4. Ensure these fields are populated as follows:
    - Homepage URL: `http://localhost:3000`
    - Authorization callback URL:
      `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`
5. Once created, retrieve the Github ID and Secret and define the Github keys.

#### ü™£ Buckets

Buckets are used for storage. We use GCP and they will likely incur some cost
for usage.

-   ‚ö†Ô∏è The information in this section is sparse.

1. Two buckets are needed, one public and one restricted. However, both of these
   need to be handled by the same service account.
2. Start by [signing up to Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/).
3. Create a project.
4. Inside the project, navigate to storage (or search for it in the console).
5. Create two buckets, each _standard_, _single-region_ (preferably near you or
   near the database). For the bucket that will be public, turn off prevent
   public access.
6. Go to the bucket that is going to be public, and go to `permissions`, click
   `Grant Access`, input `allUsers` under "New principals" and for the role
   assign `Storage Object Viewer`. If you get a warning that you're making the
   bucket public, you're on the right track.
7. Put the names of the buckets as the local environment variables: the primary
   is the restricted one while the secondary is the public.
8. Now navigate to `Service Accounts` and create a new service account. Name it
   something recognizable and give it the following roles:
   `Service Account Token Creator`, `Service Account User` and
   `Storage Object Admin` (you can also assign these roles under `IAM` page).
9. With the service account created and ready, click on it and go to the `keys`
   tab where you will `add key`->`Create new key`. Select `JSON` and click
   `Create`. This will download a `.json` file. **DO NOT SHARE THIS WITH
   ANYONE**
10. Find the key file and base64 encode it. (On linux,
    `base64 key.json > key_base64.txt`). Copy the contents into the
    `GCP_BUCKET_HANDLER_KEY` env var (be sure to remove empty carriage returns
    and enclose the contents in quotes just in case).
11. That should be it! ü•≥

#### üíµ Stripe

-   ‚ö†Ô∏è The information in this section is sparse.

In order to create and fully update courses, a Stripe connection is needed. Sign
up an account on Stripe and set up a test environment. Get the API key and
populate the `STRIPE_API_KEY` env vars.

If you want to test checkouts, you must also create a webhook connection. To
test these locally, you must have the
[Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli) running simultaneously with
your app. Once you have the Stripe CLI installed and authenticated, we have a
shortcut you can use from the project: `npm run stripe:listen`.
