## A. The Mechanical Object: Section 3

In Section 3 of A. The Mechanical Object, Hegel builds on the analysis of the
infinite regress of determinism, because, as Hegel will go on to show,
determinism leads to a contradiction that must be resolved. It is this
contradiction that will lead us to the next chapter of Mechanism.

We have already said that there is no moment of self-determination within the
`mechanical objects`. Instead, the determinateness that lies between them is
entirely external and, owing to their indifference, entirely indeterminate. As
such, the determinateness that lies between each `mechanical object` is
identical to every other. To clarify, the determinateness is identical because
there is no specific determination given to the determinateness by a particular
`mechanical object`. If every `mechanical object` is entirely indifferent to
every other `mechanical object`, then the determinateness that lies between them
is simply that: the external determinateness between two indifferent and
indeterminate `mechanical objects`. That determinateness is identical for each
`mechanical object`. So whether you have a rock slamming into a rock, or a rock
falling into the water, there is no determinate difference. In both cases, we
are basically talking about an external determinateness between two indifferent
and indeterminate `mechanical objects`. This is what is going on in the first
half of Section 3:

> Now as the determinateness of an object _lies in an other_, no determinate
> difference is to be found between them; the determinateness is merely
> _doubled_, once in one object and again in the other, something utterly
> _identical_, so that the explanation or comprehension is _tautological_. This
> tautology is an external futile see-saw; since the determinateness obtains
> from the objects which are indifferent to it no peculiar distinctiveness and
> is therefore only identical, there is before us only _one_ determinateness;
> and its being doubled expresses just this externality and nullity of a
> difference (@hegel1991logic, 714).

For Hegel, the chain of external, indifferent, determinateness between
`mechanical objects` is a mere tautology, which means that there is really only
one determinateness throughout the chain of external determinateness. This is,
more or less, a repetition of the point made in Section 2 when we were
discussing Hegel's account of determinism.

Now, the identity of the determinateness (and as my example above should have
made clear) effectively means that we treat each `mechanical object` as no
different to any other `mechanical object`. If the particular
`mechanical object` does not contribute any of its own particular
determinateness in its relation to other objects, and if it is only the external
determinateness of objects that exists between objects, then there is no
meaningful distinction between the interaction of different
`mechanical objects`. This, whilst being true for the `mechanical objects`,
nevertheless, leads to a contradiction because the `mechanical objects` are not
merely identical. They are each a totality that is indifferent to every other
`mechanical object` and so not simply the same as every other
`mechanical object`. Thus, despite having an identical determinateness they
remain different `mechanical objects`. Herein lies the contradiction of the
`mechanical object`. This is what Hegel has to say on this:

> Here, then, we have the manifest _contradiction_ between the complete mutual
> _indifference_ of the objects and the _identity_ of their _determinateness_,
> or the contradiction of their complete _externality_ in the _identity_ of
> their determinateness (@hegel1991logic, 713).

To return to my example of the rock that splashes into the water. From a
mechanistic perspective, it makes not a bit of difference whether it is a rock
or a boulder that splashed into the water because the determinateness of the
mechanical objects is identical. This identity of determinateness has the effect
of treating the `mechanical objects` as interchangeable because, with regard to
their external determinateness, there is no distinction between one or the
other. However, this is to ignore another equally crucial determination of the
`mechanical objects`: their indifference. How can two objects be treated as
identical whilst being indifferent to each other? Hegel's response is that that
is exactly where the logic of Mechanism leads us - towards the contradiction
that the determinateness of a `mechanical object` is both identical to every
other `mechanical object` whilst the object itself being indifferent to that
very identical determinateness. This contradiction, then, is comprehended and
grasped as the negative unity of the `mechanical objects`:

> This contradiction is, therefore, the _negative unity_ of a number of objects
> which, in that unity, simply repel one another: this is the _mechanical
> process_ (@hegel1991logic, 713).

The conclusion of the A. The Mechanical Object, then, is that these
`mechanical objects` that were initially taken as immediately identical,
indeterminate, and indifferent, are in fact in a contradiction with each other.
This contradiction is a negative unity whereby what it is for a
`mechanical object` to be itself is for its determinateness to be identical to
the determinateness of other `mechanical objects` (the _unity_ of the negative
unity), whilst for it to be indifferent to other `mechanical objects` (the
_negative_ in negative unity). This new unity takes us into the next chapter of
Mechanism, B. The Mechanical Process.
