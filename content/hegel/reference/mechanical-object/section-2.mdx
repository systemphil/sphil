## A. The Mechanical Object: Section 2

The thread of the logical development of the `mechanical object` is picked up in
Section 2. To briefly recapitulate, the `mechanical object` is the immediate
identity of the determinations of the `Concept`; that is to say, what it is for
the `mechanical object` to be the `mechanical object` is for the determinations
of `universality`, `particularity`, and `individuality` to be immediately
identical to each other. There is no dialectical movement between them, such
that one develops into the other, or such that their relation prompts a
dialectical development, because there is no difference to be found within or
between them. Such is the `mechanical object` that it is the unity of identical
moments that bear no difference to each other. The preceding account is to be
found in the
[first paragraph of A. The Mechanical Object](/articles/hegel/reference/mechanical-object/first-paragraph).
However, despite the indeterminacy of the `mechanical object`, again, owing to
the lack of difference within or between the determinations of the `Concept`,
there is the vaguest notion of determinateness. Determinateness remains as a
"manifoldness" (@hegel1991logic, 712); in other words, there is determinateness
simply because there are the three determinations of the `Concept` that are
immediately identical to each other. This is a formal, meagre, superficial
determinateness. It is the kind of difference that exists between three rocks
lying on the ground. They are different from each other insofar as one is “over
there” and another is “over there”, but that is all there difference amounts to,
there is nothing more refined to say about their difference. In fact, it is such
a meagre and superficial difference that one could very well ignore it and
continue thinking that they are simply identical, interchangeable, moments.

The first paragraph of Section 2 elaborates on the precise nature of the
determinateness of the `mechanical object`. Hegel tackles the tension that has
been present ever since we made explicit the essential determinateness of the
`mechanical object` that is equally indeterminate. What does it mean for the
`mechanical object` to be both essentially determinate and indeterminate?
Hegel's answer is that the `mechanical object` is indifferent [_Gleichgültig_]
to its determinateness. As we said earlier, the `mechanical object` is able to
be essentially determinate whilst being indeterminate because its moments of
determinateness are immediately identical to each other. What does this tell us
about these moments? It tells us that they are indifferent to each other - it is
indifference that explains how a moment can be both a determinateness and
indeterminate in that determinateness. As Hegel writes, the `mechanical object`
is “indifferent to the determinations as individual, as determined in and for
themselves, just as the latter are themselves indifferent to one another” (Hegel
1991, 713). As such, since each determination is indifferent to every other
determination, no determination can be comprehended from any other
determination. The idea being that if a does not actively relate to b (does not
posit b) then it would not make sense to try to understand b by understanding a.
To use an empirical example, if you have two rocks, Ra and Rb, it would not make
sense to seek to understand Rb by trying to understand Ra since what it is for
Ra to be is for it to be indifferent to Rb: Ra is perfectly able to be itself
without any explicit reference to Rb and any reference that there is to Rb is
merely a formal one, i.e. merely in virtue of the fact that both rocks happen to
be in the same place. This is what Hegel means when he concludes the first
paragraph of Section 2 with a clarification of how the `mechanical object` can
have both determinateness and be indeterminate:

> The determinatenesses, therefore, that it contains, do indeed belong to it,
> but the form that constitutes their difference and combines them into a unity
> is an external, indifferent one; whether it be a mixture, or again an order, a
> certain arrangement of parts and sides, all these are combinations that are
> indifferent to what is so related (@hegel1991logic, 713).

The determinateness of the `mechanical object`, then, is not constituted by
something "inner". In other words, the `mechanical object` does not posit the
other `mechanical object` as being in a relation to it. It's as if their
relation is given by virtue of their of their shared essential determinateness
but has nothing to do with what they are in particular. The mere fact that they
are `mechanical objects` is sufficient for them to be in a unity, and it is
because there unity is grounded in the fact that they are `mechanical objects`
that it is based on externality and indifference. One way to think about this is
as Hegel's account of the idea of external reality as given. If reality is
merely given to us, there is no internal order or reason to the arrangement of
objects, and so the relation of objects to each other is an indifferent and
merely external one. I think this is what Hegel is getting at when we look at
the next paragraph:

> Thus the object, like any determinate being in general, has the
> determinateness of its totality outside it in other objects, and these in turn
> have theirs outside them, and so on to infinity. The return into-self of this
> progression to infinity must indeed likewise be assumed and represented as a
> totality, a world; but that world is nothing but the universality that is
> confined within itself by indeterminate individuality, that is, a universe
> (@hegel1991logic, 713).

Hegel conceptualises this infinite regression of successive external
determinateness's as the “world”, in its universal form, and as the “universe”,
in its individual form. We will break down this distinction in a moment, but
let's focus on the infinite regression. Why does the `mechanical object` have
its determinateness outside of itself? Simply, because it is indifferent to any
determinateness, and so determines neither itself not any other
`mechanical object`. There is a `mechanical object` that is external to the
first `mechanical object` and the fact that there are mechanical objects that
are external to other together, what we identified earlier as their formal
unity, means that their determinateness lies external to them. But since no
`mechanical object` is capable of positing the determinateness, the external
determinateness keeps getting passed around the mechanical objects, without any
change in determinateness. This infinite regression, however, is not a line, but
a circle because there is a return into-self, because there are not infinite
mechanical objects. There are only three mechanical objects, the `universal`,
the `particular`, and the `individual`. But because their external
determinateness is never posited by any single `mechanical object` it is
infinitely being passed through them.

Let us now consider the above point concerning the world and the universe. What
Hegel means is understandable enough, but what is less clear is whether he
intends it to form a part of the logical development. First, let's consider what
is meant by it. On the face of it, Hegel is telling us that return-into-self of
the infinite progression that we discussed above is the universal moment of the
'world'. When we think about the world, within a mechanistic worldview, we think
of it is as this totality of infinitely regressive external determinacies. In an
apocryphal story, after giving a lecture on astronomy, a member of the audience
is supposed to have told Bertrand Russel that his assessment of things is wrong
and that the Earth is actually supported on the back of a turtle. Russel, being
an absolute Wit, asked the member of the audience “and what is the turtle
standing on?”, to which the member of the audience retorted, with perhaps even
greater wit, “you're a very clever young man, but it's turtles all the way
down!”. Why is it a universal? I think, because, the determinacies are all
identical to each other and do not determine each other. There is an element of
unchanging identity within the `world` - it's just one turtle after another,
without any turtle determining any other turtle.

So much for the `world` as a universal. Let us now consider Hegel's further
point. Having stated that the `world` is a moment of universality, he goes on to
write that the universality of the `world` is merely confined within itself by
the indeterminate individuality of the `universe`. To grasp the move that Hegel
makes here, from universal `world` to individual `universe`, we need to remind
ourselves of a feature of Mechanism. The `mechanical object` is the
“universality that pervades the particularity and in it is immediate
individuality" (@hegel1991logic, 710); in other words, the universal `world` is
immediately the individual `universe`, because we are within the sphere of
Mechanism where `universality` is immediately `individuality`. When we
conceptualise the `universe`, for Hegel, we are folding into itself the `world`
as universal and grasping the infinite regress of the return-into-self as a
single, indeterminate moment. We are making explicit the fact that since the
external determinacies are all identical to each other and since they do not
determine each other, that they may as well be grasped as one self-relating,
indeterminate, external, determinateness. In other words, a single `universe`.

This section concludes with a meditation on the indeterminacy of determinism. I
have alluded to this criticism of determinism in the above explanation for why
Hegel conceives of the `world` as the universal and the `universe` as the
individual. In essence, Hegel's point is that if one is to take on the thesis of
determinism: that a is caused by b, and that b is caused by c, and so on to
infinity (or to a supposed beginning), and that this mode of explanation is
sufficient to explain why a, b, and c, are as they are. But, if one is to take
on this explanation, then one must make explicit the indeterminacy of such
external determinateness:

> For this reason determinism itself is also indeterminate in the sense that it
> involves the progression to infinity; it can halt and be satisfied at any
> point at will, because the object it has reached in its progress, being a
> formal totality, is shut up within itself and indifferent to its being
> determined by another (@hegel1991logic, 713).

It is interesting that Hegel connects the indeterminacy of determinism to the
infinite regression of determinism because the infinite regress plays no role in
explaining the indeterminism of the `mechanical object`. If we cast our mind
back, the indeterminacy of the `mechanical object` is due to the immediate
identity of the `mechanical object` and that there is no difference within it.
It is this lack of difference that leads to infinite regress that is described
in the paragraph that treats of the `world` and the `universe`. The
indeterminacy that was explained by the immediate identity of the
`mechanical object` is the indeterminacy that explains why there is external and
indifferent determination. As such, it is because of the indeterminacy of the
`mechanical object` that the external determinateness of the objects is an
infinite progression, and it explains why determinism doesn't offer a
determinate explanation of things. Because what it offers by way of explanation
is merely the same explanation for every single moment, which is what prompts
Hegel to call it an “empty word” (@hegel1991logic, 714).

Crucially, the above is not a disproof of determinism or a criticism of it. It
is Hegel's account of determinism. Determinism is part of the unfolding of the
determinations of thought and being. Hegel is telling us that there is such a
thing as determinism and it works like this. Implicitly, however, there is a
criticism of determinism since determinism is supposed to be a foundational
theory - it is a theory that explains everything. However, for Hegel, the
deterministic logic is a mere moment in the first section of Mechanism, and the
`mechanical object` is shown to continue developing beyond determinism. Thus,
whilst determinism is a determination of thought and being, it is not the
absolute determination that explains everything.
