## Systemic Presuppositions in Hegel's _Science of Logic_

A long-standing criticism of Hegel's _Science of Logic_ is whether the beginning
is as presuppositionless as Hegel claims it is. Notably, Schelling understands
Hegel to covertly have a "real being" in mind when he makes his start with
`pure being`, which is what, according to him, actually propels the logic
forward since thought is discontent with a mere abstraction.

According to Schelling then, it is not the immanent logic of `pure being` that
advances the logic but the mind of the philosopher who is unable to determine
anything concrete in this utmost abstraction. Moreover, there is already a
determinacy&mdash;a presupposition&mdash;at work in thought's compulsion to move
towards more concrete being. Lack of immanence and presupposed determination
together undermine the force of presuppositionless thinking.

Schelling not only misunderstands Hegel's argument but arguably distorts it (see
Houlgate 2022, 77-78, 139-142, 154-155, 235). Unfortunately, this distortion has
not only influenced thinkers such as Søren Kierkegaard, Theodor W. Adorno, and
Martin Heidegger&mdash;both directly and indirectly&mdash;but has also had
significant repercussions for the broader reception and interpretation of
Hegel's philosophy.

That said, there _are_ presuppositions in Hegel's method of presuppositionless
thinking&mdash;though these require a more nuanced articulation (see Houlgate
2022, 101-107). The central question is whether such nuanced accounts ultimately
undermine the claim to presuppositionlessness or, paradoxically, reinforce it.

## Four Layers of Presuppositions

What follows outlines four layers of presupposition upon which the opening of
Hegel's _Science of Logic_ arguably depends: (1) extra-philosophical
preconditions, (2) historico-philosophical preconditions, (3) linguistic and
intra-logical conditions, and (4) systemic presuppositions. These form a rough
spectrum, ranging from the most innocuous to those that directly shape the
development of the logic itself. The central claim of this inquiry is that,
while most of these presuppositions are relatively benign, one layer remains
operative in determining the logical content. A further question then arises: if
this thesis holds, does it undermine the presuppositionlessness of Hegel's
_Logic_?

### Enabling Conditions: Extra-philosophical Preconditions

In the broadest sense, Hegel's _Logic_ does not emerge in a vacuum: it depends
on social, cultural and institutional developments that make possible the
understanding, motivation, and capacity to engage in speculative philosophy such
as Hegel's _Logic_. Importantly, however, such conditions _do not predetermine_
how the logic unfolds or what may be discovered in the course of its
development. Rather, they constitute the background that makes such an
undertaking possible&mdash;what Richard Dien Winfield calls “enabling
conditions” (Winfield 1989, 63, 87-88).

To illustrate, consider how the invention of the printing press was an "enabling
condition" for the spread of scientific ideas during the Renaissance. The press
did not determine the content of scientific discoveries, but it created the
necessary social and technological environment for scientists to share, debate,
and build upon their work. In a similar manner, the emergence of German Idealism
itself depended on a host of extra-philosophical developments: the rise of the
modern university system, the cultural authority of philosophy in post-Kantian
Germany, and broader Enlightenment ideals of rational autonomy. These factors
did not determine what Hegel would argue in the _Logic_, but they created the
historical space in which such a speculative project could be meaningfully
undertaken.

### Intellectual Context: Historico-philosophical Preconditions

While the historico-philosophical layer might be considered a subset of enabling
conditions, it merits distinct treatment given its close connection to the
ongoing practice of speculative philosophy. This layer is indispensable for the
formation of the philosopher's skills and serves as a conduit between
generations. The philosophical texts and traditions inherited by each generation
constitute a progressive articulation of self-consciousness. These intellectual
legacies not only elevate the present thinker by linking them to a broader
historical discourse but are themselves sustained and renewed through ongoing
philosophical engagement.

However, logically&dash;if not temporally&mdash;prior to the history of
philosophy is the general activity of thought: its capacity to take interest in
things, and its power to challenge established norms and institutions. Hegel
explicitly acknowledges that critical thinking "is sparked by the interests of
religion, of the State, of law, and of ethical life" (@hegel1991enclogic,
48/§19A3). Thought's first response is to immediate and practical matters.
However, this then spurs on the critical engagement:

> Thinking deprived what was positive of its power. Political constitutions fell
> victim to thought; religion was attacked by thought; firm religious notions
> that counted as totally genuine revelations were undermined, and in many minds
> the old faith was overthrown (@hegel1991enclogic, 48/§19A3).

Yet this initial orientation gives rise to a deeper level of critical
reflection. By what right does thought question established norms and
institutions? How is it that thought becomes intensely invested in certain
matters while overlooking others&mdash;perhaps those that should not have been
forgotten? The examination into thought and its methods becomes, Hegel surmised,
the defining concern of modern philosophy. This is exemplified in Descartes'
demand that philosophy must begin by doubting everything&mdash;and thus
presupposing nothing&mdash;in order to establish a starting point free from the
authority of the Church, tradition, or even common sense.

Descartes' rejection of authority turns out, however, to be incomplete and
provisional since he is more motivated, in Hegelian eyes, "to reach a starting
point that is firm, rather than free" (Houlgate 2022, 102-3). Nonetheless, the
drive for freedom is implicit in Descartes' demand that philosophy begins with
no presuppositions (see Houlgate 2022, 103).

With Kant, however, freedom of thought is advocated _explicitly_&mdash;reason is
"set free from all _authority_" (@hegel1991enclogic, 107/§60R). According to
Hegel, this establishes a further point of departure for philosophy: modern
metaphysics cannot take the freedom of thinking for granted and modern
philosophy presupposes it.

> From now on the principle of the independence of reason, of its absolute
> inward autonomy (_Selbständigkeit_), has to be regarded as the universal
> principle of philosophy, and as one of the assumptions (_Vorurteile_) of our
> times (@hegel1991enclogic, 107/§60R).

However, Kant only establishes the principle of free thought, but he does not
fully enact it. In fact, Hegel states he "_leaves the categories and the usual
method of cognition totally uncontested_" (@hegel1991enclogic, 106/§60R). To
live up to the demand set by Kant, Hegel thinks, one must effectively apply the
principle of independent, non-question begging thought to the method of
philosophy, namely, to logic. Hegel's own presuppositionless logic is therefore,
following Houlgate, "made necessary by, and so presupposes, the historical
development of philosophy from the Greeks, through Descartes, to Kant and the
post-Kantians" (Houlgate 2022, 103).

The fact that Hegel's speculative thinking has historical presuppositions does
not, however, determine the development of the argument. The historical
conditions&mdash;or presuppositions&mdash;make the speculative undertaking of
logic necessary, but they do not set in advance what will emerge in the course
of that logic. The historical presuppositions, as Houlgate puts it, "cannot
govern the latter, since they require that whatever does emerge be determined by
pure being alone" (Houlgate 2022, 104). Indeed, if there is a presupposition
here that does set in advance the course of the logic, it is only _that_ nothing
sets the course of logic in advance; that whatever develops (if anything),
freely follows from `pure being` alone.

But does this historical presupposition not make the contents of Hegel's _Logic_
contingent? And if it is contingent, could it have developed otherwise, if
history had taken a different turn? Houlgate argues that while the _Logic_ has a
contingent historical ground, it does not make the logic itself contingent. "For
Hegel, there is a rational necessity at work in history leading humanity from
its primitive beginnings to full self-consciousness, so in that sense modern
freedom, which makes speculative logic necessary, is not just a contingency"
(Houlgate 2022, 104). Following Houlgate's view, then, it is primarily a
question whether or not the modern age is interested in freedom and
self-criticism&mdash;at which point speculative logic simply arises or it does
not.

> If the modern age had not been interested in freedom and self-criticism, but
> had preferred the authority of tradition or of assumption, then speculative
> logic would still not have taken a different course; it would simply not have
> arisen at all. On the other hand, if the modern age had taken a slightly

> been interested in freedom and self-criticism, there would still only be one
> way in which speculative logic could proceed: the way that is determined by
> the thought of pure being (Houlgate 2022, 104).

Now, the development of speculative logic may be understood more or less well,
as Hegel's revisions of both the _Science of Logic_ and the _Encyclopaedia
Logic_ show, but Houlgate thinks that these do not show fundamentally different
routes through speculative logic but rather demonstrate the difficulty, time and
effort to properly understand the immanent development of being (see Houlgate
2022, 104).

In addition to the history of philosophy itself, Hegel notes that philosophy
owes a debt to the empirical sciences&mdash;particularly the ones that rest on
experience. Hegel understands empirical science to already go beyond what is
contingently given in sensuous impressions in order to discover the necessary
rationality at work in them through universal determinations, genus and species,
laws and forms. As Hegel writes:

> the experiential sciences carry with them the stimulus to vanquish _the form_
> in which the wealth of their content i s offered only as something that is
> merely immediate and simply found, as a manifold of _juxtaposition_, and hence
> as something altogether _contingent_. They are stimulated to elevate this
> content to [the level of] necessity (@hegel1991enclogic, 36/§12).

Empirical science does not halt at appearances or individual instances of
perception but gather and elevate these under a schema or model. This in turn
provokes investigation into the nature of these universal determinations, laws,
forms, schemas and models themselves, thus going beyond these as _merely given_.
As Hegel continues:

> this stimulus pulls thinking out of its abstract universality, and out of the
> satisfaction that is only warranted _implicitly_; and it drives thinking on to
> _develop_ itself by _its own means_ (@hegel1991enclogic, 36/§12).

The laws and models developed by empirical science upon the sensuous givens
renders these mediated by universal determination and elevates their content by
grasping the inherent rational necessity at work in them. But the same principle
is applied to the laws themselves, whereby these too cannot be merely taken as
given but must themselves undergo the same critical inquiry. Once this step is
taken, in Hegel's eyes, thinking has already stepped into speculation about its
own laws and forms. What remains then is to make explicit this inquiry and to
let it develop itself, no longer by sensuous or perceptual means, but purely by
its own conceptual ones.

### TODO

- Check Robb Dunphy's work!
- Identity of form and content force the focus on to the thinking itself not
  merely what is thought, so it must also incorporate _how_ that thinking is
  developed.
- In addition, there is the how of form and content itself, how this is
  motivated.
