## Systemic Presuppositions in Hegel's _Science of Logic_

A long-standing criticism of Hegel's _Science of Logic_ is whether the beginning
is as presuppositionless as Hegel claims it is. Notably, Schelling understands
Hegel to covertly have a "real being" in mind when he makes his start with
`pure being`, which is what, according to him, actually propels the logic
forward since thought is discontent with a mere abstraction.

According to Schelling then, it is not the immanent logic of `pure being` that
advances the logic but the mind of the philosopher who is unable to determine
anything concrete in this utmost abstraction. Moreover, there is already a
determinacy&mdash;a presupposition&mdash;at work in thought's compulsion to move
towards more concrete being. Lack of immanence and presupposed determination
together undermine the force of presuppositionless thinking.

Schelling not only misunderstands Hegel's argument but arguably distorts it (see
Houlgate 2022, 77-78, 139-142, 154-155, 235). Unfortunately, this distortion has
not only influenced thinkers such as Søren Kierkegaard, Theodor W. Adorno, and
Martin Heidegger&mdash;both directly and indirectly&mdash;but has also had
significant repercussions for the broader reception and interpretation of
Hegel's philosophy.

That said, there _are_ presuppositions in Hegel's method of presuppositionless
thinking&mdash;though these require a more nuanced articulation (see Houlgate
2022, 101-107). The central question is whether such nuanced accounts ultimately
undermine the claim to presuppositionlessness or, paradoxically, reinforce it.

## Four Layers of Presuppositions

What follows outlines four layers of presupposition upon which the opening of
Hegel's _Science of Logic_ arguably depends: (1) extra-philosophical
preconditions, (2) historico-philosophical preconditions, (3) linguistic and
intra-logical conditions, and (4) systemic presuppositions. These form a rough
spectrum, ranging from the most innocuous to those that directly shape the
development of the logic itself. The central claim of this inquiry is that,
while most of these presuppositions are relatively benign, one layer remains
operative in determining the logical content. A further question then arises: if
this thesis holds, does it undermine the presuppositionlessness of Hegel's
_Logic_?

### Enabling Conditions: Extra-philosophical Preconditions

In the broadest sense, Hegel's _Logic_ does not emerge in a vacuum: it depends
on social, cultural and institutional developments that make possible the
understanding, motivation, and capacity to engage in speculative philosophy such
as Hegel's _Logic_. Importantly, however, such conditions _do not predetermine_
how the logic unfolds or what may be discovered in the course of its
development. Rather, they constitute the background that makes such an
undertaking possible&mdash;what Richard Dien Winfield calls “enabling
conditions” (Winfield 1989, 63, 87-88).

To illustrate, consider how the invention of the printing press was an "enabling
condition" for the spread of scientific ideas during the Renaissance. The press
did not determine the content of scientific discoveries, but it created the
necessary social and technological environment for scientists to share, debate,
and build upon their work. In a similar manner, the emergence of German Idealism
itself depended on a host of extra-philosophical developments: the rise of the
modern university system, the cultural authority of philosophy in post-Kantian
Germany, and broader Enlightenment ideals of rational autonomy. These factors
did not determine what Hegel would argue in the _Logic_, but they created the
historical space in which such a speculative project could be meaningfully
undertaken.

### Intellectual Context: Historico-philosophical Preconditions

While the historico-philosophical layer might be considered a subset of enabling
conditions, it merits distinct treatment given its close connection to the
ongoing practice of speculative philosophy. This layer is indispensable for the
formation of the philosopher's skills and serves as a vital conduit between
generations. The philosophical texts and traditions inherited by each generation
constitute a progressive articulation of self-consciousness. These intellectual
legacies not only elevate the present thinker by linking them to a broader
historical discourse but are themselves sustained and renewed through ongoing
philosophical engagement.

However, logically&dash;if not temporally&mdash;prior to the history of
philosophy is the general activity of thought: its capacity to take interest in
things, and its power to challenge established norms and institutions. Hegel
explicitly acknowledges that critical thinking "is sparked by the interests of
religion, of the State, of law, and of ethical life" (@hegel1991enclogic,
48/§19A3). Thought's first response is to immediate and practical matters.
However, this then spurs on the consequent critical engagement:

> Thinking deprived what was positive of its power. Political constitutions fell
> victim to thought; religion was attacked by thought; firm religious notions
> that counted as totally genuine revelations were undermined, and in many minds
> the old faith was overthrown (@hegel1991enclogic, 48/§19A3).

Yet this initial orientation gives rise to a deeper level of critical
reflection. By what right does thought question established norms and
institutions? How is it that thought becomes intensely invested in certain
matters while overlooking others&mdash;perhaps those that should not have been
forgotten? The examination into thought and its methods becomes, Hegel surmised,
the defining concern of modern philosophy. This is exemplified in Descartes'
demand that philosophy must begin by doubting everything&mdash;and thus
presupposing nothing&mdash;in order to establish a starting point free from the
authority of the Church, tradition, or even common sense.

Descartes' rejection of authority turns out, however, to be incomplete and
provisional since he is more motivated, following Hegel, "to reach a starting
point that is firm, rather than free" (Houlgate 2022, 102-3).

### TODO

- Identity of form and content force the focus on to the thinking itself not
  merely what is thought, so it must also incorporate _how_ that thinking is
  developed.
- In addition, there is the how of form and content itself, how this is
  motivated.
