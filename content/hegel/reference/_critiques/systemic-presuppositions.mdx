## Systemic Presuppositions in Hegel's _Science of Logic_

A long-standing criticism of Hegel's _Science of Logic_ is whether the beginning
is as presuppositionless as Hegel claims it is. Notably, Schelling understands
Hegel to covertly have a "real being" in mind when he makes his start with
`pure being`, which is what, according to him, actually propels the logic
forward since thought is discontent with a mere abstraction.

> necessity which lies in the philosopher and which is imposed upon him by his
> memory (Schelling 1994, 138).

According to Schelling then, it is not the immanent logic of `pure being` that
advances the logic but the mind of the philosopher who is unable to determine
anything concrete in this utmost abstraction. Moreover, there is already a
determinacy&mdash;a presupposition&mdash;at work in thought's compulsion to move
towards more concrete being. Lack of immanence and presupposed determination
together undermine the force of presuppositionless thinking.

Schelling not only misunderstands Hegel's argument but arguably distorts it (see
Houlgate 2022, 77-78, 139-142, 154-155, 235). Unfortunately, this distortion has
not only influenced thinkers such as Søren Kierkegaard, Theodor W. Adorno, and
Martin Heidegger&mdash;both directly and indirectly&mdash;but has also had
significant repercussions for the broader reception and interpretation of
Hegel's philosophy.

That said, there _are_ presuppositions in Hegel's method of presuppositionless
thinking&mdash;though these require a more nuanced articulation (see Houlgate
2022, 101-107). The central question is whether such nuanced accounts ultimately
undermine the claim to presuppositionlessness or, paradoxically, reinforce it.

## Four Layers of Presuppositions

What follows outlines four layers of presupposition upon which the opening of
Hegel's _Science of Logic_ arguably depends: (1) extra-philosophical
preconditions, (2) historico-philosophical preconditions, (3) linguistic and
intra-logical conditions, and (4) systemic presuppositions. These form a rough
spectrum, ranging from the most innocuous to those that directly shape the
development of the logic itself. The central claim of this inquiry is that,
while most of these presuppositions are relatively benign, one layer remains
operative in determining the logical content. A further question then arises: if
this thesis holds, does it undermine the presuppositionlessness of Hegel's
_Logic_?

### Enabling Conditions: Extra-philosophical Preconditions

In the broadest sense, Hegel's _Logic_ does not emerge in a vacuum: it depends
on social, cultural and institutional developments that make possible the
understanding, motivation, and capacity to engage in speculative philosophy such
as Hegel's _Logic_. Importantly, however, such conditions _do not predetermine_
how the logic unfolds or what may be discovered in the course of its
development. Rather, they constitute the background that makes such an
undertaking possible&mdash;what Richard Dien Winfield calls “enabling
conditions” (Winfield 1989, 63, 87-88).

To illustrate, consider how the invention of the printing press was an "enabling
condition" for the spread of scientific ideas during the Renaissance. The press
did not determine the content of scientific discoveries, but it created the
necessary social and technological environment for scientists to share, debate,
and build upon their work. In a similar manner, the emergence of German Idealism
itself depended on a host of extra-philosophical developments: the rise of the
modern university system, the cultural authority of philosophy in post-Kantian
Germany, and broader Enlightenment ideals of rational autonomy. These factors
did not determine what Hegel would argue in the _Logic_, but they created the
historical milieu in which such a speculative project could be meaningfully
undertaken.

### Intellectual Context: Historico-philosophical Preconditions

While the historico-philosophical layer might be considered a subset of enabling
conditions, it merits distinct treatment given its close connection to the
ongoing practice of speculative philosophy. This layer is indispensable for the
formation of the philosopher's skills and serves as a conduit between
generations. The philosophical texts and traditions inherited by each generation
constitute a progressive articulation of self-consciousness. These intellectual
legacies not only elevate the present thinker by linking them to a broader
historical discourse but are themselves sustained and renewed through ongoing
philosophical engagement.

However, logically&dash;if not temporally&mdash;prior to the history of
philosophy is the general activity of thought: its capacity to take interest in
things, and its power to challenge established norms and institutions. Hegel
explicitly acknowledges that critical thinking "is sparked by the interests of
religion, of the State, of law, and of ethical life" (@hegel1991enclogic,
48/§19A3). Thought's first response is to immediate and practical matters.
However, this then spurs on the critical engagement:

> Thinking deprived what was positive of its power. Political constitutions fell
> victim to thought; religion was attacked by thought; firm religious notions
> that counted as totally genuine revelations were undermined, and in many minds
> the old faith was overthrown (@hegel1991enclogic, 48/§19A3).

Yet this initial orientation gives rise to a deeper level of critical
reflection. By what right does thought question established norms and
institutions? How is it that thought becomes intensely invested in certain
matters while overlooking others&mdash;perhaps those that should not have been
forgotten? The examination into thought and its methods becomes, Hegel surmised,
the defining concern of modern philosophy. This is exemplified in Descartes'
demand that philosophy must begin by doubting everything&mdash;and thus
presupposing nothing&mdash;in order to establish a starting point free from the
authority of the Church, tradition, or even common sense.

Descartes' rejection of authority turns out, however, to be incomplete and
provisional since he is more motivated, in Hegelian eyes, "to reach a starting
point that is firm, rather than free" (Houlgate 2022, 102-3). Nonetheless, the
drive for freedom is implicit in Descartes' demand that philosophy begins with
no presuppositions (see Houlgate 2022, 103).

With Kant, however, freedom of thought is advocated _explicitly_&mdash;reason is
"set free from all _authority_" (@hegel1991enclogic, 107/§60R). According to
Hegel, this establishes a further point of departure for philosophy: modern
metaphysics cannot take the freedom of thinking for granted and modern
philosophy presupposes it.

> From now on the principle of the independence of reason, of its absolute
> inward autonomy (_Selbständigkeit_), has to be regarded as the universal
> principle of philosophy, and as one of the assumptions (_Vorurteile_) of our
> times (@hegel1991enclogic, 107/§60R).

However, Kant only establishes the principle of free thought, but he does not
fully enact it. In fact, Hegel states he "_leaves the categories and the usual
method of cognition totally uncontested_" (@hegel1991enclogic, 106/§60R). To
live up to the demand set by Kant, Hegel thinks, one must effectively apply the
principle of independent, non-question begging thought to the method of
philosophy, namely, to logic. Hegel's own presuppositionless logic is therefore,
following Houlgate, "made necessary by, and so presupposes, the historical
development of philosophy from the Greeks, through Descartes, to Kant and the
post-Kantians" (Houlgate 2022, 103).

The fact that Hegel's speculative thinking has historical presuppositions does
not, however, determine the development of the argument. The historical
conditions&mdash;or presuppositions&mdash;make the speculative undertaking of
logic necessary, but they do not set in advance what will emerge in the course
of that logic. The historical presuppositions, as Houlgate puts it, "cannot
govern the latter, since they require that whatever does emerge be determined by
pure being alone" (Houlgate 2022, 104). Indeed, if there is a presupposition
here that does set in advance the course of the logic, it is only _that_ nothing
sets the course of logic in advance; that whatever develops (if anything),
freely follows from `pure being` alone.

But does this historical presupposition not make the contents of Hegel's _Logic_
contingent? And if it is contingent, could it have developed otherwise, if
history had taken a different turn? Houlgate argues that while the _Logic_ has a
contingent historical ground, it does not make the logic itself contingent. "For
Hegel, there is a rational necessity at work in history leading humanity from
its primitive beginnings to full self-consciousness, so in that sense modern
freedom, which makes speculative logic necessary, is not just a contingency"
(Houlgate 2022, 104). Following Houlgate's view, then, it is primarily a
question whether or not the modern age is interested in freedom and
self-criticism&mdash;at which point speculative logic simply arises or it does
not.

> If the modern age had not been interested in freedom and self-criticism, but
> had preferred the authority of tradition or of assumption, then speculative
> logic would still not have taken a different course; it would simply not have
> arisen at all. On the other hand, if the modern age had taken a slightly
> different form, with perhaps different states in the ascendancy, but had still
> been interested in freedom and self-criticism, there would still only be one
> way in which speculative logic could proceed: the way that is determined by
> the thought of pure being (Houlgate 2022, 104).

Now, the development of speculative logic may be understood more or less well,
as Hegel's revisions of both the _Science of Logic_ and the _Encyclopaedia
Logic_ show, but Houlgate thinks that these do not show fundamentally different
routes through speculative logic but rather demonstrate the difficulty, time and
effort to properly understand the immanent development of being (see Houlgate
2022, 104).

In addition to the history of philosophy itself, Hegel notes that philosophy
owes a debt to the empirical sciences&mdash;particularly the ones that rest on
experience. Hegel understands empirical science to already go beyond what is
contingently given in sensuous impressions in order to discover the necessary
rationality at work in them through universal determinations, genus and species,
laws and forms. As Hegel writes:

> the experiential sciences carry with them the stimulus to vanquish _the form_
> in which the wealth of their content is offered only as something that is
> merely immediate and simply found, as a manifold of _juxtaposition_, and hence
> as something altogether _contingent_. They are stimulated to elevate this
> content to [the level of] necessity (@hegel1991enclogic, 36/§12).

Empirical science does not halt at appearances or individual instances of
perception but gather and elevate these under a schema or model. This in turn
provokes investigation into the nature of these universal determinations, laws,
forms, schemas and models themselves, thus going beyond these as _merely given_.
As Hegel continues:

> this stimulus pulls thinking out of its abstract universality, and out of the
> satisfaction that is only warranted _implicitly_; and it drives thinking on to
> _develop_ itself by _its own means_ (@hegel1991enclogic, 36/§12).

The laws and models developed by empirical science upon the sensuous givens
renders these mediated by universal determination and elevates their content by
grasping the inherent rational necessity at work in them. But the same principle
is applied to the laws themselves, whereby these too cannot be merely taken as
given but must themselves undergo the same critical inquiry. Once this step is
taken, in Hegel's eyes, thinking has already stepped into speculation about its
own laws and forms. What remains then is to make explicit this inquiry and to
let it develop itself, no longer by sensuous or perceptual means, but purely by
its own conceptual ones.

It is seen how the history of ideas and empirical science jointly cultivate the
environment for the speculative thinking needed to undertake presuppositionless
philosophy. In addition to these, however, there is the philosopher herself, as
an individual, who must be educated and mentally equipped for the task at hand,
"as it requires a trained ability at withdrawing into pure thought, holding onto
it and moving within it" (@hegel1991enclogic, 45/§19R). Hegel notes the
importance of these in the ability to acquaint oneself with the universal
principles at stake in one's time, to give reasons for and against a position,
to be able to give an "orderly" account of the matter at hand and give it a
"serious" judgment (Hegel 2018, 5/§4). Above all, however, Hegel writes that
education should facilitate a space of the serious examination and pursuit of a
_fulfilled life_ whereby it becomes possible not merely to _reflect on the
matter_ (_die Sache_) but also _experience it_:

> the commencement of cultural education will first of all also have to carve
> out some space for the seriousness of a fulfilled life, which in turn leads
> one to the experience of the crux of the matter (_die Erfahrung der Sache
> selbst_), so that even when the seriousness of the concept does go into the
> depths of the crux of the matter (Hegel 2018, 5/$4).

Hegel also notes a certain acceleration in learning that increases with the
development of human minded activity. What was once advanced theory that
occupied adult minds become mere exercises, if not games, for future younger
pupils. The individual increasingly reflects the entire human minded development
within themselves&mdash;not literally, but as the contours of the total mental
progression. "In this pedagogical progression, we recognize the history of the
cultural formation of the world sketched in silhouette. This past existence has
already become an acquired possession of the universal spirit; it constitutes
the substance of the individual, or, his inorganic nature" (Hegel 2018, 18/§28).
Much of this learning is cemented&mdash;or, internalized&mdash;within the
individual as implicit or as habit, which is what allows for the further
advancement of knowledge. For example, one must be skilled in language prior to
appreciating the linguistic twists and turns&mdash;at times to their breaking
point&mdash;latent in dialectical thinking.

More specifically, what matters most for the task of speculative logic is the
ability to think abstractly. If one is unable to detach oneself from concrete
reality and figurative imagery, then the abstract categories of speculative
logic will prove to be impenetrable if not utterly meaningless. Hegel notes one
of the chief difficulties when approaching philosophy is its abstractness:

> The difficulty lies partly in the inability (which in-itself is just a _lack
> of practice_) to think abstractly, i. e., to hold on to pure thoughts and to
> move about in them. In our ordinary consciousness thoughts are affected by and
> united with the sensible and spiritual material with which we are familiar;
> and in thinking about something, in reflecting and arguing about it, we mix
> feelings, intuitions, and representations with thoughts (@hegel1991enclogic,
> 27/§3R).

What makes philosophy, in large part, is precisely the ability to distill
concepts _from_ the otherwise concrete fusion that make the objects of ordinary
experience. To use Hegel's example, to state "The leaf is green" involves
categories like `being` and `singularity`. The contents of pure thought, then,
emerge as the result of being able to sift through real concrete objects and
abstract away all sensuous and figurative elements.

Hegel notes a valuable aid in formal logic to train one's ability to think
abstractly. Through it, he writes, "we sharpen our wits; we learn to collect our
thoughts, and to abstract. ...in abstraction ... the mind concentrates on one
point, and we acquire in that way the habit of occupying ourselves with what is
inward" (@hegel1991enclogic, 52/§20A). Being able to assign an abstract
proposition "A" to any content and perform work with that proposition in
conjunction with others in order to derive meaningful conclusions through purely
logical rules is an essential step in developing one's mind for speculative
thought. This activity of the mind to distinguish matters into discrete objects
is given the name _understanding_ (_Verstand_) by Hegel: "The activity of
separating is the force and labor of the _understanding_, the most astonishing
and the greatest of all the powers, or rather, which is the absolute power"
(Hegel 2018, 20/§32).

However, fully self-critical speculative thought requires that the laws and
rules of formal logic&mdash;indeed, its _formality_, which implies a fundamental
difference between form and content&mdash;must be dispensed with. The "fixity"
that characterizes thinking in formal logic&mdash;the static rules of inference
and operators, the prevalence of the category of identity in propositions and
simplistic, atomistic non-contradictory thought processes, etc.&mdash;turn out
to be unquestioned assumptions where fully self-critical thinking is involved.
In other words, speculative thought proper requires one to go beyond the
activity of the understanding.

Now, there is an important nuance to the understanding and its role in the
speculative logic. Hegel readily acknowledges the understanding plays an
indispensable role _in determining_ the categories of speculative logic, which
means that the understanding cannot be entirely dispensed with or disregarded.
But the understanding alone would reduce speculative thought to mere formality.
Rather, then, the understanding is needed to make distinctions&mdash;to
_categorize_; however, these distinctions cannot be held fast to in virtue of
simply being established; these distinctions must be able to be dropped, as it
were, should there be any logical development. This causes a tension of the
understanding with itself. Houlgate explains this tension thus:

> Before the start of speculative logic, understanding is thus in a complex and
> somewhat contradictory position. It is required by its own commitments to
> suspend its distinctions and to begin with pure being: for what makes such a
> suspension necessary is its own stress on freedom (_as opposed_ to mere
> authority) and on proof and necessity (_as opposed_ to contingent assumption).
> Understanding is thus led into speculative philosophy by _holding to_ its
> commitments, and so being itself, as consistently as possible. Yet
> understanding is required, by holding consistently to its commitments,
> precisely to _give up_ itself and its “fixity”. ... By being consistently
> itself, therefore, understanding is required to cease being itself. Yet
> understanding gives up being itself precisely by being itself and doing what
> is characteristic of it, namely _abstracting_ (in this case, from
> itself)(Houlgate 2022, 106).

The precise question of whether it is understanding that must let go, or whether
some other mental activity intervenes, lies beyond the current scope of
discussion. Suffice it to say, however, that such considerations are far from
trivial in speculative thought, and that engaging with them properly requires a
trained ability, informed by millennia of philosophical development, to abstract
carefully&mdash;not only the contents of thought, but also their form.

### Words and Meaning: Linguistic and Intra-logical Conditions

The linguistic and intra-logical layer further refines the scope introduced by
the preceding layer of historical-philosophical preconditions by examining more
closely the use of language in speculative thought&mdash;particularly in Hegel's
_Logic_&mdash;and the mental constraints involved. Language&mdash;particularly
in the form of writing&mdash;is absolutely essential not only for the
communication of philosophy but also for its creation, a point Hegel is acutely
aware of.

In the first instance, Hegel notes that language _generally_ houses logic.
Logic, or the spiritual element, permeates entirely the natural human being in
her behavior, ways of sensing, intuiting, desiring, needs and impulses, ways of
representing, imagining and thinking. Logic&mdash;_the nature_ of the human
being&mdash; is expressed through language.

> The forms of thought are first set out and stored in human _language_, and one
> can hardly be reminded often enough nowadays that thought is what
> differentiates the human being from the beast. In everything that the human
> being has interiorized, in everything that in some way or other has become for
> him a representation, in whatever he has made his own, there has language
> penetrated, and everything that he transforms into language and expresses in
> it contains a category, whether concealed, mixed, or well defined (Hegel 2010,
> 12/21.10).

Hegel further notes that language contains a set of logical expressions.
Expressions specific for pure thought determinations, such as, for example,
`concept`, `essence` and `form`, `equality`, `identity` and so on. However, he
also thinks that certain forms of language have expressions better suited for
philosophical inquiry. He notes that "categories should be expressed as
substantives and verbs, and thus be stamped into objective form", such that they
can have the "further peculiarity of carrying, not just different meanings, but
opposite ones, and in this one cannot fail to recognize the language's
speculative spirit" (Hegel 2010, 12/21.10). Words that are able to carry
opposite meanings excel at revealing a feature of logic that is otherwise
difficult to express, namely, dialectical development through conflict and
contradiction. For example, the word "custom" can mean something special and
unique, or something common and traditional; two meanings that are at odds. Or,
to take another, the word "apology" can be a statement of regret or a defense
and justification, as in the case of Plato's _Apology_ of Socrates.

Philosophical concepts need no special terminology, Hegel claims, and the
introduction of foreign words are only made meaningful through habit. However,
philosophy is enriched indirectly through the advance of culture and the
sciences. In Hegel's own time, the category `force` was dominant in physics but
was already being developed with a more speculative edge through defining "a
difference in which the different terms are inseparably bound together" (Hegel
2010, 13/21.11). However, being the study of nature, the relative stable reality
of objects (which is perhaps not so stable in modern physics) could not give
room to consider their terms in utmost generality, as is the case in the
humanities.

While philosophy needs no special terminology, Hegel does recognize this comes
with an overhead elsewhere, namely, in the distinguishing of terms from their
ordinary to their philosophical use in order to gain new knowledge in what is
essentially familiar. If all the terms of philosophy broadly exist, then
philosophy must construct a special context that renders all its words in a way
_unfamiliar_. This in turn requires a transition that indicates "the general
features of the course that cognition goes through as it leaves familiar
acquaintance behind, the essential moments in the relationship of scientific
thought to this natural thought [that is, natural thought is unconscious or
automatic thinking]" (Hegel 2010, 13/21.12, added insertion). Indeed, Hegel even
acknowledges this as a "general idea" that is necessitated by the science of
speculative thinking prior to the science itself (Hegel 2010, 13/21.12).

Hegel goes on to elaborate what distinguishes philosophical use of terms from
their everyday use by describing the core of philosophy.

> The indispensable foundation, the concept, the universal which is thought
> itself (provided that with the word “thought” one can abstract from figurative
> representation), cannot be regarded as _just_ an indifferent form that
> attaches _to_ a content. But these thoughts of all things natural and
> spiritual, even the substantial _content_, still contain a variety of
> determinacies and are still affected by the distinction of soul and body, of
> concept and reality relative to it; the profounder foundation is the soul
> standing on its own, the pure concept which is the innermost moment of the
> objects, their simple life pulse, just as it is of the subjective thinking of
> them. To bring to consciousness this _logical_ nature that animates the
> spirit, that moves and works within it, this is the task (Hegel 2010,
> 17/21.15).

He then adds that an instinctive- and freely intelligent act is distinguished by
whether or not it is performed consciously: "when the content that motivates a
subject to action is drawn out of its immediate unity with the subject and is
made to stand before it as an object" (Hegel 2010, 17/21.15). The categories
normally do their work instinctively and in this regard are, when made aware of,
variable and mutually confusing, affording the human minded activity only an
only fragmentary and uncertain reality. It is the task of philosophy, Hegel
claims, to purify the categories&mdash;to consider them in the purity of
thought.

That a category _can_ be purified must mean that it is _of_ pure thought. While
_all_ concepts are in some respect nominally pure in virtue of being _concepts_,
not all concepts are categories or thought-determinations. The concept of horse
is not a category because, (1) it is not of pure thought but also, (2) it cannot
contain all other concepts. The concept of `being`, on the other hand, is of
pure thought and does contain all other concepts (albeit via dialectical
development). There is no sense, then, in attempting to "purify" the concept of
horse. But this presupposes one already has a fairly clear cut distinction of
what counts as categories and what does not?

Hegel offers further clues: "what in ordinary reflection is, as content, at
first separated from the form cannot in fact be in itself formless, devoid of
determination; that it rather possesses form in it; indeed that it receives soul
and substance from the form alone and that it is this form itself which is
transformed into only the semblance of a content, hence also into the semblance
of something external to this semblance" (Hegel 2010, 18-19/21.17). A category,
then, must also instantiate its form _as content_. It this we could say that a
category is _being_ its form rather than just declaring it or being a mere
signpost to it. The concept of a horse, then, (3) is not a category because its
concept is only the externalization of horse, not its being or presence. The
category of `being` at once instantiates its _being_; indeed, this is what it
means to be `being`&mdash;to _immediately_ be. In thinking `being`, there is its
presence.

This conjunction of form and content, or what one could call the externalization
and the presence, Hegel calls _the fact_ [_die Sache_] &ndash; the `concept` of
all things.

Now, there are of course many concepts just as there is a multitude of facts.
But to this Hegel responds that any concepts is also _the_ `concept`. The
`concept` is the "substantial foundation" of each concept, and what marks a
concept off from _the_ `concept` is the matter of what determinateness appears
(and remains obscured) in the particular concept (which is to say that the
difference between concept and `concept` is not a question of mere determinacy,
since the latter is, strictly speaking, no less determinate).

The `concept` plays the pivotal role in furnishing meaning to the three points
outlined above: (1) pure thought, (2) containment within all concepts and, (3)
inseparability of externalization and presence, or form and content. But how is
this form or structure itself established? Hegel strategy is to seriously
consider all categories&mdash;and in effect, "candidates" for the
`concept`&mdash;and understand that "the result can only be the demonstration of
their finitude and of the untruth of their supposed being-for-itself, and that
the concept is their truth" (Hegel 2010, 19/21.17).

As categories primarily appear to function instinctively and unconsciously in
the human being, this fact must be attended to in the course of the examination:

> inasmuch as the science of logic deals with the thought determinations that
> instinctively and unconsciously pervade our spirit everywhere &ndash; and
> remain non-objectified and unnoticed even when they enter language &ndash; it
> will also be a reconstruction of those determinations which reflection has
> already abstracted and fixed as subjective forms external to a material
> content (Hegel 2010, 19/21.17-18).

Hegel's overall claim then is that categories are implicit in the human minded
activity, many of which&mdash;if not all&mdash;are expressed and used in
everyday, non-philosophical language and activity. The task of philosophy is to
pick out these categories and view them, not in respect to each other or to
sensuous reality and worldly perceptions&mdash;as they are usually
regarded&mdash;but purely in their own light.

But all this still leaves one with a difficult conundrum. How does one
sufficiently distinguish the philosophical use of a category from its
non-philosophical? When does one know that a concept such as "difference" is
used in its technical sense, or, conversely, when does one know for sure that
the use of "opposition" does not evoke the technical category in a manner that
inadvertently determines the content?

This question is not a question of language per say, that is, it is not an issue
as to the meaning or meanings of a category, but with recognizing which meaning
is being actualized in the logical development.

Consider some examples:

> _Pure being and pure nothing are therefore the same_ (Hegel 2010, 59/21.69).

Does "same" here presuppose or evoke the category `identity` (developed much
later in the Doctrine of Essence)? Is `identity` here determining the categories
`being` and `nothing`?

> But the truth is just as much that they are not without distinction; it is
> rather that they are not the same, that they are absolutely distinct... (Hegel
> 2010, 60/21.69).

Does "distinction" or "absolutely distinct" here refer to the category
`difference` (also developed in Essence)? Is `difference` here involved
determining the two categories at hand?

> Hence _being-in-itself_ is, first, negative reference to non-existence; it has
> otherness outside it and is opposed to it (Hegel 2010, 93/21.108).

Likewise, is "opposing" here dependent on the category `opposition`? Is it
playing a role in determining `something's` `being-in-itself`?

> Existence proceeds from becoming. It is the simple oneness of being and
> nothing (Hegel 2010, 83/21.97).

Does "oneness" here refer to the category of the `one`, developed later in the
Doctrine of Being? Is it engaged here in any way?

There are many more such instances throughout the _Logic_ where one could pose
similar questions. The main points, however, are the same: Are the terms here
connected to their categories? If so, are they involved in determining the
actual category at hand? Or are they merely expressing what, in the movement of
thought, has already taken place? But how can there be any inseparability
between language and concepts here in the logical development if the latter only
comes _to be_ through the former? Moreover, explicitness is a crucial
cornerstone in Hegel's logic, such that it would be disingenuous to the
programme of presuppositionless thinking to rely on implied notions to carry the
logic forward.

Given that Hegel recognizes all categories as embedded in human language and
unconsciously at work within it, the terms in question must be bound to their
respective categories. The issue, then, is whether they also participate in the
determination of the present development. If they do not, we would have to
assume a separation between language and concepts&mdash;such that one could
advance without the other. But this seems untenable: not because it would be in
tension with presuppositionless thinking, but because presuppositionless
thinking already undermines the very possibility of such a separation; positing
it would itself amount to the introduction of an unaccounted-for logical
structure.

It appears that the categories evoked in the course of the present logical
development must themselves play a role in determining the matter. One might
formulate this more innocuously by saying that the matter determines itself
through what is immediately implied in these notions. Yet the difficulty arises
from the fact that some categories actively participate in the present
development, and the question remains: _How_ can one know whether these terms
define the matter in a way that does not presuppose their later logical
development? How does one know to grasp enough of these terms without externally
determining the matter at hand? For otherwise, the logic would risk becoming
viciously circular or contain invalid presuppositions.

To this end, there seems to be an intelligibility at work in cognizing the
present category _as_ that category, with other terms serving only a supportive,
descriptive role&mdash;but this intelligibility itself unfolds within a set of
constraints imposed by certain special systemic presuppositions operative at the
lowest levels.

### Creative Constraints: Systemic Presuppositions

TBC

### TODO

- Consider Robb Dunphy's work.
- Is Hegel's response to the conundrum a matter of "philosophical training" or
  is there a verification, logical or linguistic, that one can perform on the
  content? Or would Hegel simply come back at us and point out that we are once
  again presupposing some category that is doing our work?
- Identity of form and content force the focus on to the thinking itself not
  merely what is thought, so it must also incorporate _how_ that thinking is
  developed.
- In addition, there is the how of form and content itself, how this is
  motivated.
