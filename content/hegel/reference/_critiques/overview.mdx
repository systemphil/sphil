## Overview of Critical Inquires into Hegel's _Science of Logic_

This section gathers sustained engagements with Hegel's _Science of Logic_ that
move beyond the treatment of individual categories. These inquiries trace
tensions, contradictions, and underlying presuppositions that cut across the
logical system as a whole. Some challenge the coherence of the dialectical
movement; others interrogate its ontological, epistemological, or methodological
claims. Together, they form a space where the logic is not only explicated but
also placed under scrutiny&mdash;questioned, confronted, and thought anew.
