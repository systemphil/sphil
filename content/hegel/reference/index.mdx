## Welcome to the Hegel Reference Section

Welcome to the Hegel Reference section of sPhil. This section provides a
detailed exploration of the categories and determinations in Hegel's philosophy.
Our goal is to offer a thorough resource for understanding Hegel's thought and
to facilitate extensive discussions on these philosophical concepts.
