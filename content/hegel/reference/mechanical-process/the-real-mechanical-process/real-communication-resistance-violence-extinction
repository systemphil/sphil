## (b) The Real Mechanical Process: Real Communication, Resistance, Violence, and Extinction

The `real mechanical process` begins like the `formal mechanical process`: with a moment of communication. In order to distinguish the two kinds of communication we will call this one `real communication`, even though Hegel does not use this term. So, `real communication` is the process through which object a communicates its determinateness to object b. What distinguishes `real communication` from `formal communication` is that the determinateness that is communicated is actually taken up by object b. It is not merely returned, as in the moment of `reaction`, the way an elastic band snaps back without any real alteration to its being, but it is actually taken up and determines the determinateness of object b, like a cannon ball being shot at a city wall. This is all there is to the moment of `real communication`: that the determinateness is communicated in a concrete sense, that the determinateness as that specific determinateness is communicated to another object and taken up by that object. 

We must now consider what the consequences is of the determinateness of object a being communicated to object b. Now, we cannot forget that object b is still a self-subsistent object: in other words, it is a totality unto itself and makes no reference to anything other than itself. As such, it is possible that object b takes up the determinateness of object a but remains unaffected by it. To continue with our example, the cannon ball hits the city wall but does not destroy it – though it affects it, perhaps a few stones fall down, but the city wall remains and Hegel calls this `resistance`. In `resistance` the object’s individuality has resisted the communicated universality. But `resistance` can be overcome when the self-related negativity of the object’s individuality is inadequate to the communicated universal. Crucially, `resistance` is not overcome because object b is not self-subsistent, but because its self-subsistence relative to the communicated determinateness is inadequate. The inadequacy boils down to object b being determined by object a – the city wall has collapsed because of the determinateness of the cannon ball. Hegel characterises this moment as the moment when `power` becomes `violence` and what marks this movement is the fact that the universal determinateness of object a exceeds the determinateness of object b. For Hegel, the determinateness of the resistant object by the universal object leads to `extinction` – and we can see why that is the case, the determinateness of the individual is supposed to be self-subsistent, but it has failed to be self-subsistent. The object that goes extinct is the object that had set itself up as self-subsistent but which has proven to not be self-subsistent against its own objective universality and to have suffered `violence` by it.

## The Real Mechanical Process and Fate

What are we to make of Hegel’s analysis here? How are we to understand these determinations of `real communication`, `resistance`, `power`, and `violence`? It seems plausible that they could be understood in scientific, social, or political ways. Hegel’s discussion of an objective universality and a resisting individual evokes images of a government imposing its will on a people; or of war between different nations; or of higher-level physical, though inanimate, relations. But is this correct? In the next paragraph, Hegel goes into a discussion on the concept of fate and connects the objective universality to fate. Insofar as fate is supposed to be this blind, mechanical force, that has an all-encompassing power on the world, it aligns well with Hegel’s conception of `real communication`. But Hegel draws an interesting distinction about the realm of objective universality between self-conscious beings and non-self-conscious beings: namely, only self-conscious beings can be in a relation with objective universality. This tells us that, according to Hegel, the real mechanical process does not exist in the realm of inanimate objects but must involve human beings. Automatically, then, Hegel excludes brute mechanical phenomena from this section of the `Mechanism` and we will have to analyse why exactly that is. Uncovering Hegel’s reasons for this division in subject-matter will elucidate how he understands the wider implications of the `real mechanical process`. 

Hegel writes: “Only self-consciousness has a fate in the proper meaning of the word, because it is free, and therefore in the individuality of its ego possesses a being that is absolutely in and for itself and can oppose itself to its objective universality and estrange itself from it” (Hegel 1991, 720). Note that the self-conscious being estranges itself from its objective universality – as we noted above in the analysis of `violence`, the `violence` occurs when the objective universality that was identical to the resistant object is no longer adequate to it. There is, thus, a shift within the determinateness of the resistant object that opens it up to `violence` from its very own objective universality. If we follow Hegel’s example of fate, we can align this analysis with the portrayal of fate in the story of Oedipus, for example. Oedipus grows up in a family that adopts him as a baby, but without knowing of his adoption. When he reaches manhood, Oedipus is told a prophecy that he will murder his father and marry his mother. The prophecy naturally terrifies him and so he flees from his city and takes himself as far away from his family as he can. As we know, Oedipus will go on to murder King Laius and to marry Queen Jocasta, who it is later revealed are his biological parents. Thus, the tragedy of Oedipus is that he estranged himself from his family and his home thinking that he was keeping them safe from himself, but in doing so embarked on his path to fulfil his tragic fate. The logical coordinates here are that his fate is the objective universality, his attempt to escape his fate is his moment of resistance, and due to his resistance his determination as Oedipus is not longer in line with his fate as Oedipus and so he experiences his fate, his own objective universality, as a violence that destroys him. 

Hegel’s alignment of objective universality with fate tells a broader story about the importance of `Mechanism` and, more germanely, about the relevance of the `real mechanical process` to life. Imagine a different scenario, where Oedipus knew of his fate and had accepted it – a kind of stoicism or Christian asceticism – the impact of these events would not be violence but something more akin to the relations of the formal mechanical process. That is a perfectly reasonable approach to dealing with objective universality, but there is an abstractness and formality to it that leaves much to be desired. Hegel connects this with his world history. He writes, echoing the sentiment of the philosophy of world history, that:  “The nation without deeds is without blame; it is wrapped in objective moral universality and dissolved in it and lacks that individuality” (SL, 721). One can forever act in concert with the objective morality of their world and entirely disregard their individuality, but doing so will render you a human being of no deeds. What leads to development are the deeds that one does, and the only way to commit a deed is do something that requires you to set yourself in opposition to your objective universality and to assert your individuality, which will invariably open you to violence.
