## (a) The Formal Mechanical Process: Section 3

### Coming To Rest

The previous section concluded the moments of `action` and `reaction` with the moment of `rest`. Undoubtedly, another nod to Newton's laws of motions, though this time to the first law of motion. What exactly the connection is between Newton and Hegel in the development of the `formal mechanical process` is a fascianting topic that deserves further attention. Focusing on the logical development, however, the object comes to `rest` because it has expelled the determinateness that was communicated to it because of its indifference to any determinateness. As such, the object has shown the process of `communication` to be entirely superficial since it did not affect the object beyond engaging it to react to the communicated determinateness with indifference. The moment of `rest` is when the mechanical object has returned into itself. In other words, the object’s determinateness went out of itself through `communication`, it collided with other objects in `action` and `reaction`, and the object has returned to being itself by expelling this determinateness entirely. Now, this moment of returning into itself is crucial for Hegel because it acts as the moment when the `Concept` as a totality has been posited. 

### The Product Of The Formal Mechanical Process

Prior to the `formal mechanical process`, the determinations of the `Concept` where immediately identical, indeterminate, and indifferent to each other. We asserted that there was an essential determinateness between them, that they were fundamentally bound together by virtue of being the determinations of the `Concept` – but it was such a superficial connection because there was no active connection between them. But through the `formal mechanical process`, we saw how each determination developed into the other – we saw how `communication` as universality developed into `action` and `reaction` as particularity, which in turn developed into `rest` as individuality. The explicit development of these determinations demonstrates that the `Concept` is now posited as a totality – as the explicit unity of these three determinations that are indifferent and external to each other. This `mechanical object` is the product of the formal mechanical process as the object for which the indifference and externality to determinateness is posited as the essential relationship between the determinations of the `Concept`. This positing also brings the `mechanical object` into the sphere of necessity, and out of the contingency of the opening of `Mechanism`. Suffice it to say, that Hegel sees the `product of the formal mechanical process` as heralding the moment of necessity into `Mechanism`, and that the basic conceptual reason for this is connected to the fact that the determinations of the `Concept` are now mediated through themselves. This reflection into itself makes the objects in the mechanical process more determined.

The establishment of the `product of the mechanical process` is the hinge-point for the transition into the `real mechanical process`. The objects within the mechanical process now stand in a more determinate relationship to each other. That means a few things: One, it means that they are no longer immediately identical. At the beginning of `Mechanism`, there was no difference between the moment of universality and the moment of particularity. But through the `formal mechanical process`, the mediation of the `Concept`, there is at least a formal distinction between these determinations of the `Concept`. Two, the object is no longer indeterminate but has the opposition that is latent in it as its determinateness. As such, what it is for the `mechanical object` to be is for it to be in an oppositional relation to other mechanical objects. Three, and this follows from the first two, the object is no longer simply indifferent to determinateness. The conclusion of the `formal mechanical process` is that we have a `mechanical object` that is in an oppositional relationship to other mechanical objects and so not simply indifferent. It is self-subsistent in the sense that its determinateness is not connected to or dependent on anything external to it, but it is now embedded into a more relational state with other objects. The object is in a state where what it is, is much more open to alteration by the external determinateness of other objects than it previously was.
