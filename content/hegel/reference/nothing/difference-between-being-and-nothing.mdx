## The Difference Between Being and Nothing

Following the early logical development of Hegel's _Science of Logic_, pure
being and pure nothing are understood to be the same. Each proves to be other
yet, equally, both are the same such that they cannot be properly distinguished.
However, Hegel insists that they are "absolutely distinct" (Hegel 2010,
60/21.70). What is the sense of this distinction?

Typically, one would _determine_ a distinction by developing some quality,
property or some other form of being through which the two are differentiated.
However, at the earliest stages of the _Logic_, determinacy itself has not been
developed, such that determinacy cannot justifiably be employed to distinguish
the two categories.

> said, they would be determinate being and determinate nothing, not the pure
> being and the pure nothing which they still are at this point (Hegel 2010,
> 68/21.79).

One cannot then make use of some distinguishing factor for an idea that is
omnipresent; there is no conceptual space, as it were, where one might draw a
border without evoking that space again.

Moreover, determining something that would distinguish `being` from `nothing`
also annuls the purity of these terms. If some determinacy were to obtain for
either, then they are no longer understood in their purity and the initial
meaning of these categories would be lost as well as invalidating their early
development. What difference could possibly remain then?

### The Immediate Difference Between Pure Being and Pure Nothing

{/* If more commentary is added to this article, consider categorizing by commentator. */}

John McTaggart notes that there is more to `being` and `nothing` than their
identity. He puts it that each term "originally meant" different things, namely,
by `being` it was intended to a "pure positive&mdash;reality without unreality",
and by `nothing`, conversely, was intended a "pure negative&mdash;unreality
without reality". Whilst the two terms have been discoverd to be equivalent, a
contradiction has nonetheless arisen. The original meaning has not been
discarded: "For it is that same characteristic which determines their
equivalence" (McTaggart 1910, 16-17).

Stephen Houlgate points out that the difference between `being` and `nothing`
lies in _intention_ [_Im Meinen_]: "There is no clear, determinate difference
between the two, but they are nonetheless _meant_ to be different" (Houlgate
2022, 144). He adds that this is not a difference we, as human beings, draw, but
belongs to `being` and `nothing` themselves. They are themselves absolutely
distinct.

Notice how each category immediately means something unique to itself yet is
_then_ regarded upon reflection in relation to its opposite. But this relation
hardly merits the name of a relation since neither category has built into it
any form of contrast, whether explicitly or implicitly. Each category simply is.

This simplicity coupled with immediacy sets the difference between `pure being`
and `nothing`. "Being and nothing are immediately different because each is
purely and immediately _itself_ and thereby completely excludes the other ...
each in being itself _in fact_ shuts out the other" (Houlgate 2022, 144). This
signals that there is in `pure being` nothing but `pure being`, or, put
differently, there is in the thought of `pure being` no conceptual space for
anything else&mdash;not even `nothing`.

Likewise, as Houlgate goes on to point out, this difference is unsustainable and
disappears the moment it is thought. It is merely an _immediate difference_ and
so nothing persists beyond this immediacy. Indeed, `being` and `nothing`
_vanish_ into each other such that the immediate difference between them is
undermined: each is just as indeterminate as the other, and this indeterminacy
applies back to the difference as well. "This vanishing in turn renders explicit
the fact that the _immediate_ difference between being and nothing is an utterly
_indeterminate_ one" (Houlgate 2022, 145).

The immediate difference between `being` and `nothing` turns out to be a
self-sublating or self-undermining one. `being` and `nothing` are _immediately_
different, but this difference fails to persist beyond the vanishing of `being`
and `nothing`. Each category differs, therefore, "in such a way that neither is
definitely &ndash; and so stably &ndash; itself but each vanishes into its
opposite" (Houlgate 2022, 145).

This has a further implication regarding the nature of purely immediate
difference, namely, that what is so purely immediately different is so only in a
contradictory and utterly unstable manner. Hegel's dialectic reveals that while
`being` _is_ distinct from `nothing`, it is _also_ utterly indistinguishable
from it.

However, as Houlgate points out, the immediate difference between `being` and
`nothing` is not simply eliminated but is restored in its very disappearance.
The logic for this idea is the following:

1. As `being` and `nothing` prove to be (and vanish into) each other, such that
   the difference between them disappears, they prove to be the same
   indeterminacy. This can be seen as the moment of uniformity.
1. Yet, `being` and `nothing` prove to be the same _by vanishing_ into each
   other, in and so doing remain _other_ than one another. The vanishing of each
   occurs precisely through remaining immediately different from the other:
   "each vanished by proving to be the _other_ in which it is completely absent"
   (Houlgate 2022, 145). This, by contrast, can be viewed as the moment of
   distinction.
1. These two moments occur _at once_, for each category in question proves to be
   the other _in being immediately different_ to the other that it vanishes into
   as well as _being the same_ as the other. The difficulty in grasping this
   lies in trying to separate the two moments from each other and understand
   them sequentially, but Houlgate's point is that these must occur in the same
   movement.
1. Thus, in annihilating itself, the immediate difference between `being` and
   `nothing` has restored itself.
1. Finally, the immediate difference between `being` and `nothing` is thus
   doubly contradictory. Firstly, it is a difference that is not a difference,
   and, secondly, it is one that, in disappearing, restores itself.[^1]

[^1]:
    Any trace to the term "preserve" has been omitted from the logic of
    Houlgate's argument both for simplification and because it is contentious
    (Niklas).

Houlgate uses the term "preserve" alongside "restore" in his exposition of this
argument. However, the term "preserve" suggests that the _singularly_ same
immediate difference between `being` and `nothing` is carried through its
disappearance. But there is no distinguishing factor either for or against this;
the difference is exactly immediate and so nothing determinate can be made out
about it that would definitively show that it is one or the other, namely, that
it is _this_ immediate difference between `being` and `nothing` or _the same
type of_ immediate difference between `being` and `nothing` (as being the
instance of a class). For all intents and purposes, this matter may be
inconsequential but it is not unambiguous.

{/* TODO Revisit this when commentary on the Concept is written. Trisokkas uses the term "preserve" as a peculiar characteristic of the concept. */}

### The Dynamism of Being

> 2010, 61/21.71).

The opening of the _Science of Logic_ quickly violates the principle of
non-contradiction or the law of identity. The form of thinking involved in
Hegel's logic disrupts that kind which clings on to clear and definite
distinctions between `being` and `nothing`, such as that found in Parmenides
which resists the thought that they could ever be the same (Houlgate 2022, 146).
The idea that a thing could only ever be the thing that it is, or whose being is
identical to itself, is disproven at the very outset of the _Logic_, for at the
very least `being` (and `nothing`) is unable to _simply be_ &ndash; it vanishes
into `nothing`.

As Houlgate describes it, there is nothing mysterious or irrational about the
dialectical change taking place in `being` and `nothing` into each other. "That
dialectical conversion is logically necessary: being and nothing pass into one
another for the reasons we have seen, and the immediate difference between them
thereby proves to be, of necessity, an indeterminate, unstable difference"
(Houlgate 2022, 146). Hegel therefore does not mean to flout the traditional
principles of reasoning or to undermine rational argument, he is simply
revealing the "dynamism in being that he takes to become evident when one
focuses on being in its purity and immediacy _without uncritically assumed
preconceptions_" (Houlgate 2022, 146). When `being` is considered
[without presuppositions](/articles/hegel/guides/presuppositionless-thinking),
the argument of the _Logic_ is unassailable: `pure being` is utterly incapable
to simply be.

### Parallel Categories, Divergent Conceptions (Niklas)

When considering the respective transitions of being and nothing, note that the
text concerning the development of these categories is slightly divergent.. The
development of `being` ends with it turning out to be `nothing`, whereas the
development of `nothing` ends with it turning out to be _the same as_ `being`.

The former case uses _is_ whereas the latter case uses _same_. The first
signifies a more immediate transition whereas the latter seems to convey the
sense of some essence, an "area" where being and nothing are conjoined. If the
two categories were to be differentiated in terms of immediacy and mediation,
`nothing` appears to fall on the side of mediation. If this notion of _sameness_
indeed belongs to `nothing` inasmuch as it is the thought that reveals the
sameness of the two, then it could be thought of as the "gathering" or
aggregating category whilst `being` signals "dispersal" or diremption.

This has the implication that not only does `being` and `nothing` immediately
mean something different, but that there is a different conceptual movement at
work in each of them. One breaks off into new ground whereas the other coalesces
a return to what was.

Alternatively, this element of sameness is conjoined with the intention of the
immediate difference between `being` and `nothing`, and that that intention is
the presence of `becoming` (Hegel 2010, 68/21.79), such that this is not a
peculiar property of `being` or `nothing` but is the alpha of the emergent
category.
