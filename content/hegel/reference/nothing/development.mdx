### Examination

```md
_Nothing, pure nothingness_
```

Similar to [`being`](/articles/hegel/reference/being/development#examination),
the account of `nothing` begins with a fragment. The first word states the
category in question which is then followed up by a qualifier that this category
is to be understood in its purity.

```md
it is simple equality with itself, complete emptiness, complete absence of
determination and content; lack of all distinction within.
```

Combined with the initial fragment, `nothing` is not to be understood as the
absence or lack of something specific, as, for example, "there is nothing in my
bank account". Rather, `nothing` _is_ complete emptiness, complete absence of
any specificity, matter or existence. Indeed, one can say it is the absence of
being. Internally, there is nothing to pick out since no distinction can be
made.

Attempting to grasp it by other means, such as void, will be inadequate since
void has a richer and more determinate meaning, such as "this cheque is void".
Void specifically points to a determinate existent which is void. This is
developed later in Hegel's _Logic_.

Equally, thinking of `nothing` in terms of negation or negativity is also
inadequate, since both terms deal with determinacy and negativity in particular
is a term that is profound, nuanced and richly textured.

The idea of `nothing` cannot but be considered through itself&mdash;in "simple
equality with itself"&mdash;that is, without reference to anything else.

```md
- In so far as mention can be made here of intuiting and thinking, it
makes a difference whether something or _nothing_ is being intuited or thought.
To intuit or to think nothing has therefore a meaning; the two are distinguished
and so nothing _is_ (concretely exists) in our intuiting or thinking; or rather
it is the empty intuiting and thinking itself, like pure being.
```

Following an en dash along with a change in tone, Hegel goes on to elaborate and
reflect through a brief
[inline comment](/articles/hegel/reference/_annotations/textual#inline-comments)
about the development so far.

If one thinks about `nothing` in terms of intuiting or thinking, that is, as an
idea that is being considered by a mind, then immediately a difference emerges
between the idea and its thinking. In thinking or intuiting `nothing`, thought
or intuition simply are empty, or it is empty thinking or empty intuiting.
However, there is nonetheless a difference here since empty thinking (or empty
intuiting) is still _thinking_, and that in itself is not empty, or at least the
emptiness here in question would not be pure and total but one contextualized to
a form.

Hegel goes to add a link between the empty thinking (or empty intuiting) that
follows the consideration of `nothing` to be like the empty thinking (or empty
intuiting) that follows pure `being`. This may suggest a way in which the
transition from one to the other is made, namely, by a syllogism between `being`
and `nothing` with "empty thinking" as the middle term. But this goes outside
the categories in question and imposes an external assumption of mind. Moreover,
it would mean that the transition of `being` into `nothing` is not native to
`being` but is some effect of the idea and mind in a particular disposition
coming together. The discipline of
[presuppositionless thinking](/articles/hegel/guides/presuppositionless-thinking)
is long broken and the many assumptions here accrue only more philosophical
debt.

Instead, it is better to understand Hegel's passage here to be an aid to the
reader that merely reflects on the logic rather than developing it further. This
being that the two categories appear to be equally devoid of any meaning, or map
on to similar, if not same, manner of thinking. However, the claim that `being`
is `nothing` is not on account of empty thinking or any other mental operation
no, but purely through its concept.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```md
- Nothing is therefore the same determination
or absence of determination, and thus altogether 
the same as what pure _being_ is.
```

The final sentence begins with an en dash that may indicate the termination of
the inlined comment and a return to the logical development. Further to this is
the fact that the passage here has no superfluous material.

It is this on account of the same determination or total lack of determination,
which renders `nothing` to be the _same_ as `being`.

Note that Hegel at this point does not strictly state that pure `nothing` is
pure `being`, but only that `nothing ` is _the same as_ `being`. This may imply
that `nothing` is `being` or that one has transitioned into the other, as Hegel
goes on to indicate in the next category, but the text does not state this
identification or transition explicitly.

## Further Commentary

### Burbidge

John Burbidge's more psychological reading of the development of the _Logic_
offers helpful guidance in understanding the otherwise very minimal and obscure
notion of `nothing`. He begins by stressing that the understanding or cognition
that thinks this category has only `pure being` to compare `nothing` with and
that it struggles to find any distinguishing identifier: each category is
likewise "simply equal with itself", "complete emptiness, absence of all
determination and content" and "internally undifferentiated or pure". Yet, some
difference must remain, according to Burbidge:

> The only difference that could possible remain is that _being_ represents that
> feature which _every_ thing has, and which enables it to be thought at all,
> whereas nothing is _no_ thing (Burbidge 1981, 39).

Burbidge states next that in the very moment no thing is thought it makes sense
to say that one intuits `nothing`. He then claims that by virtue of the
deployment of this category _in our thought_ and _applied to our intuitions_, it
necessarily "is", in the same sense a unicorn "is" (Burbidge 1981, 39).

However, when attempting to clarify the matter, the understanding is unable to
find any new definitions beyond those found in being and thought moves once
again to thinking `being`.

It is not entirely clear how `nothing` is supposed "to be" (or be a case that
"is") according to Burbidge without an external reference to thought or
intuitions, which are each far more concrete concepts than the simple
categories. The attached footnote points to a passage in _The Phenomenology_
from the Miller translation: "...Spirit is this power only by looking the
negative in the face, and tarrying with it. This tarrying with the negative is
the magical power that converts it into being" (Burbidge 1981, 243).[^1]
However, this only reinforces the presupposition as the reason why `nothing`
turns into `being` is because of an external factor, namely, spirit, rather than
something native to the category in question.

[^1]:
    More context around the passage reads: "Spirit is not this power which, as
    the positive, avoids looking at the negative, as is the case when we say of
    something that it is nothing, or that it is false, and then, being done with
    it, go off on our own way on to something else. No, spirit is this power
    only by looking the negative in the face and lingering with it. This
    lingering is the magical power that converts it into being. - This power is
    the same as what in the preceding was called the subject, which, by giving
    existence to determinateness in its own element, sublates abstract
    immediacy, or, is only existing immediacy, and, as a result, is itself the
    true substance, is being, or, is the immediacy which does not have mediation
    external to itself but is itself this mediation" (Hegel 2018, 21/§32).

### Houlgate

Stephen Houlgate offers a detailed examination of the development of `nothing`.
In contrast to Parmenides, whose idea of `nothing` is that of a contrast to
`being`[^2], Houlgate points out that for Hegel, `nothing` is not to be regarded
as a negative or absence of something but "a negative from which being is
altogether absent ... the sheer and utter _nothing_, in which there is no trace
of being whatsoever" (Houlgate 2022, 132).

[^2]:
    "Parmenides conceives being from the outset in opposition to nothing: being
    _is_, whereas nothing is _not_. Furthermore, this opposition is absolute:
    being does not emerge from or pass into nothing, but remains always and only
    being. Being _is_, and it never proves to be anything other than being: it
    is changeless, 'uncreated and imperishable'" (Houlgate 2022, 138).

Having established the absolute nothingness of `nothing`, Houlgate next points
out that, by virtue of its purity as absolute nothingness, "nothing has an
_immediacy_ to it: it is simply and immediately nothing, and nothing else
besides" (Houlgate 2022, 132). Thus, this precise _immediacy_ proves `nothing`
to be:

> utterly indeterminate _being_: for simple immediacy, at this stage in
> speculative logic, is all that being is understood to be (Houlgate 2022, 132).

This sense of immediacy is further stressed through the self-equality of
`nothing`. This simple quality with itself at once means that `nothing` is
_immediately itself_. Houlgate additionally refers to §88 of Hegel's
_Encyclopaedia Logic_, where, Hegel writes: "And similarly, but conversely,
nothing, as this immediate [term] that is equal to itself, is the same as being"
(@hegel1991logic, 141/§88). And so Houlgate concludes that, "just as pure being,
by virtue of its indeterminacy, vanishes into nothing, so pure nothing, by
virtue of its immediacy, vanishes into being" (Houlgate 2022, 143).

Houlgate additionally notes that while Hegel may seem to suggest that pure
nothing turns to being because, as Hegel's text shows, "nothing _is_ (exists) in
our intuiting or thinking", he reminds us that speculative logic does not
provide an account of what happens to being and nothing when they are thought
_by us_ human beings. The unfolding of these categories, their "fate" as it
were, certainly requires human thought, but it is not human thought that
determines what these categories are.

> The development Hegel traces ... is not a product of our thinking; rather, it
> is made necessary, logically, by being and nothing themselves and is simply
> made explicit and articulated by thought. In speculative logic, our thought
> does not determine the development that the categories of being and
> [nothing][^3] undergo, but it is itself determined by the immanent logical
> development of those categories (Houlgate 2022, 143).

[^3]:
    The passage reads "being and thought" but thought is not a category, so this
    must be a textual error (Niklas).

Houlgate thus states that it cannot be due to any operation of the mind, the
understanding, intuition or some other cognitive faculty that determines the
nature of the categories of being and nothing, but only these categories
themselves in the instance they are thought purely through themselves.

Incidentally, this immediacy of `nothing` serves to show that `nothing` is
`being`, yet self-equality is a feature of `being` just as much as it is of
`nothing`. How is it sufficient for `nothing` to be `being` in virtue of
self-equality, when that is not the case for `being` to be `nothing`? Both
categories are each self-equal and indeterminate, yet for only one of them does
one of these features play a significant role: in the case of `nothing` it is,
as we have seen, immediacy, and for, `being` it is indeterminacy. This is a
question to further investigate when the
[immediate difference between being and nothing]() is put to focus.

### McTaggart

John McTaggart notes the misunderstanding of equating being and nothing with
concrete things, namely, that "on the mistaken view that the Logic asserts the
identity of a concrete object which has not that quality&mdash;of a white table
with a black table" (McTaggart 1910, 15). And that therefore the presence of
some quality, such as whiteness, is not equivalent to its absence. But precisely
_this_ point is helpful in understanding the relationship of `being` and
`nothing`. The category `nothing` is not equivalent to `being`, at least on the
face of it (McTaggart 1910, 15).

McTaggart illustrates this point further by noting that when an idea
dialectically moves to its antithesis, it "is never the mere logical
contradictory of the first, but is some new idea which stands to the first in
the relation of a contrary" (McTaggart 1910, 16). This leads to the key point
that the denial of one is not the affirmation of the other.

Negating being does not affirm nothing, but, rather, affirms non-being; but that
development cannot occur at this stage in the _Logic_ since it requires an
entity whose being can be differentiated with regards to its non-being. Pure
being cannot be differentiated vis-à-vis its non-being, much less being _a
being_ apart from _being as such_. This reinforces the understanding that
`nothing` is not to be regarded as the denial of `being`, but the "assertion of
the absence of all determination" (McTaggart 1910, 16).
