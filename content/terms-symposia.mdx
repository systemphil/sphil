# Terms of Use for Online Courses

**1. Acceptance of Terms**  
By purchasing and accessing any course on Symposia ("Platform"), a service
provided by Eru Iluvatar Ltd., at [sphil.xyz](https://sphil.xyz), you agree to
abide by these Terms of Use. If you do not agree, you must refrain from using
the Platform and its content.

**2. License and Access**  
Upon purchase, you are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and
revocable license to access and stream the course materials for personal and
non-commercial use only. You do not acquire any ownership rights to the content.

The purchase of a base-tier course grants lifetime access to the content,
meaning access will remain available for as long as the Platform is in
operation. The Platform does not guarantee perpetual availability in the event
of service discontinuation.

**3. Course Availability**  
Not all lectures may be available at the time of the course release. However,
all lectures will become available within three (3) months of the course's
initial release date.

**4. Live Seminars**  
Certain courses may include live seminars as part of a seminar-tier offering.
The Platform guarantees a specified number of live seminars per seminar tier,
but the dates and times may be subject to change due to illness, emergencies, or
other unforeseen circumstances. In such cases, a makeup seminar will be
scheduled within a reasonable time frame.

Live seminars will be recorded and made available to the buyer. However, you
expressly agree that you shall not:

- Download, copy, or reproduce any seminar recordings in any form, unless
  explicitly permitted.
- Record, screen capture, or otherwise duplicate the seminar content.
- Share, distribute, resell, or publicly display the seminar recordings.

**5. Restrictions on Use**  
You expressly agree that you shall not:

- Download, copy, or reproduce any course content in any form, unless explicitly
  permitted.
- Record, screen capture, or otherwise duplicate the video content.
- Share, distribute, resell, or publicly display the course materials.
- Grant access to your account to others or share your login credentials.
- Use the content for any commercial or unauthorized educational purposes.

**6. Intellectual Property Rights**  
All course materials, including but not limited to videos, text, images, and
supplementary resources, are the intellectual property of Eru Iluvatar Ltd. or
its licensors. Unauthorized use, reproduction, or distribution is strictly
prohibited and may result in legal action.

**7. Refund Policy**  
The Platform offers a 7-day money-back guarantee from the time of purchase. If
you are not satisfied with the course, you may request a refund within 7 days,
subject to review and approval. Refund requests should be submitted through the
Platform's designated support channels.

**8. Termination of Access**  
Violation of these Terms may result in immediate suspension or termination of
access to the course without refund. The Platform reserves the right to take
legal action against any individual or entity that breaches these terms.

**9. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability**  
The courses are provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. The Platform is
not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from
the use of the content.

**10. Amendments**  
The Platform reserves the right to update these Terms at any time. Continued use
of the courses after changes have been posted constitutes acceptance of the
revised terms.

**11. Governing Law**  
These Terms shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of
the United Kingdom. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts of the United
Kingdom.

By purchasing and accessing any course, you acknowledge that you have read,
understood, and agreed to these Terms of Use.
