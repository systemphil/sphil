# Local Development

Settings up local development takes a bit of work, but it's absolutely worth it
if you plan on contributing often to sPhil. The following is a guide on how to
set up a local development environment on Windows. If you're on Mac, you're on
your own. Just kidding, the process should be roughly the same. (Linux users are
probably smart enough to figure it out on their own.)

Furthermore, this guide is split into lite and full versions. The lite version
is for those who just want to write and edit the content, but don't plan on
running the site locally or involve themselves with the programmatic parts. The
full version is for those who do want to get fully involved, code and all, and
run the site locally.

### Lite Version

#### Terminals and Installation

First, get acquainted with your terminal. Windows comes with Command Prompt, but
we recommend using either
[PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.4)
or [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) instead. PowerShell is best
installed from Window's App Store, while Git Bash is best installed from the
link above. The simplest way to launch a terminal in Windows is to press `Win`
button and type `powershell` or `git bash` into the prompt (note you want
`powershell`, not `windows powershell`). This launches a terminal from the
user's home directory (usually). No need to do anything yet but know how to
start a terminal when we need it.

Now, you will need to install the following on your local machine:

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
-   A text editor (We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but
    you can use whatever you want)
-   [GitHub Command Line Interface](https://cli.github.com/)

With the tools installed, open up a terminal and navigate to a directory where
you want to store the sPhil codebase. For example, if your terminal starts you
in your root user directory, you can make a new folder for all your development
projects by typing `mkdir dev` and then `cd dev` to navigate into the new
folder.

If your terminal starts you in your system directory, you can navigate to your
user directory by typing `cd ~` (the long route is to type `cd ../..` and then
type `cd Users/<your-username>`). Then, you can make a new folder for all your
development projects by typing `mkdir dev` and then `cd dev` to navigate into
the new folder.

#### Cloning the Repository

Now, we need to clone the repository. First, retrieve the link from your GitHub
copy of sPhil and type `git clone <insert-url-here> sphil` into your terminal.
This will create a new folder called `sphil` in your current directory and clone
the repository into it. It is important you have exactly one space between all
the elements of the command.

Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the `sphil` folder by typing
`cd sphil`. You should now be in the root directory of the repository.

#### Editing Content

Inside the `sphil` directory in your terminal, type `code .` to open the
repository in VS Code. This will open a new VS Code window with the repository's
contents. From here you can look around and open any file to view and edit its
contents. At its core, VS Code is really just a text editor, so you can use it
to edit any text file, which is what programming source files largely are.

The content of the sPhil is stored in the `content` folder. Here you will find a
folder for each article of the website.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    VS Code will likely prompt you about installing some extensions based on the
    file-types it detects in the repository. You can install them if you want,
    but they are not necessary for editing the content. However, we do recommend
    installing a few.
    <ul>
        <li>- Better Comments</li>
        <li>- MDX</li>
        <li>- vscode-icons (if you want swanky icons)</li>
    </ul>
</Callout>

#### Committing Changes and Pushing to GitHub

Once you've made some changes to the content, you can commit them to your local
repository. First, open up a terminal in VS Code by pressing the `TERMINAL`
button at the bottom panel and type `git status`. This will show you all the
files you've changed since the last commit. (Note: the panels in VS Code can be
adjusted by dragging the divider between them.)

Next, type `git add .` to add all the changed files to the commit. Then, type
`git commit -m "<insert-commit-message-here>"` to commit the changes. The commit
message should be a short description of the changes you made. For example, if
you added a new page, you could type `git commit -m "Added new page on X"`.

Finally, type `git push` to push the changes to your GitHub copy repository. You
will be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password. Once you do, the
changes will be pushed to your GitHub repository.

Open your browser and navigate to your GitHub repository. You should see the
changes you made in the repository and you can open a PR to the source
repository from there.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Use the GitHub CLI to login to your GitHub account and push changes to your
    repository. This will save you from having to enter your username and
    password every time you push changes. Use the command{" "}
    <code>gh auth login</code> to login to your GitHub account. You can also use
    the command <code>gh auth status</code> to check if you're logged in.
</Callout>

### Full Version

The full version extends the lite version by adding the ability to run the site
locally. This is useful for testing out changes to the site before pushing them
to the source repository. You need to have the lite version set up before you
can do the full version.

#### Installation

In addition to all the other things installed previously, you need to install
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). We recommend installing the LTS
version. Once installed, open up a terminal and type `node -v` to check that
it's installed correctly. You should see the version number of the Node.js
installation.

Next, navigate to your local `sphil` repository in a terminal and type
`npm install` to install all the dependencies. This will take a while, so go
grab a coffee or something. Once it's done, you're ready to run the site
locally.

If you use VS Code, some extensions you might want to install are:

-   Better Comments
-   MDX
-   ESLint
-   Git Graph
-   Git History
-   Pretty TypeScript Errors
-   Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
-   vscode-icons (if you want swanky icons)

#### Running the Site Locally

In order to run sPhil locally, you require a number of environmental variables.
See the
[technical contributing guide](https://github.com/systemphil/sphil/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Troubleshooting

Running into issues? Google is your friend and should be the first stop to debug
any issues you run into. Second you can try ChatGPT or an other AI; they're good
for basic issues but for more advanced problems they tend to be more an
obstacle. Usually, the best source is the documentation website for the specific
program or tool in which you're having trouble with. If you can't find a
solution, feel free to reach out to the sPhil team for help.
