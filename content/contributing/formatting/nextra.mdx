## Nextra Site Generation Framework

Nextra is the tool that powers [nextjs.org](https://nextjs.org) and
[vercel.com](https://vercel.com). It's a framework for building static sites
with Next.js. It's built on top of Next.js and adds a bunch of features that
make it easy to build static sites, such as our website here.

## Built-in Components

Nextra comes with some handy tools out of the box for us to use. Note that these
will only work in `.mdx` files.
