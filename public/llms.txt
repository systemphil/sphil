# sPhil — Encyclopaedia & Encyclopaedia of Philosophy

> sPhil (sphil.xyz) is an educational philosophy platform offering rigorous courses on humanity's greatest philosophical and literary texts alongside a free, open-source encyclopaedia of philosophy. Founded by Filip Niklas, PhD and Ahilleas Rokni, PhD (University of Warwick), sPhil makes transformative philosophical study and education accessible beyond academic walls.

sPhil has two pillars: paid handcrafted courses with pre-recorded lectures and live seminars led by expert instructors and a free open encyclopaedia where anyone can contribute scholarly philosophical content. The platform emphasises depth over breadth, primary text engagement, and scholarly rigour delivered in accessible language.

The encyclopaedia is built on open-source principles. All encyclopaedia content is licensed under CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 and contributions are made via GitHub pull requests. The codebase is licensed under Apache 2.0.

## Teaching Philosophy

sPhil's instruction follows five core principles:

1. **Text First** — Primary sources centre all instruction; secondary literature supplements but never replaces direct engagement with the text.
2. **Depth Over Breadth** — Deep comprehension of fewer texts is valued over shallow coverage of many.
3. **Active Engagement** — Students read, think critically, and form their own interpretations rather than passively absorb summaries.
4. **Scholarly Rigour with Accessibility** — High academic standards communicated in clear, approachable language.
5. **Lifelong Learning** — The platform is a companion in an ongoing pursuit of wisdom, not a one-time credential.
