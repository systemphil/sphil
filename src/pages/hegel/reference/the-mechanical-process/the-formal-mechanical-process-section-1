## (a) The Formal Mechanical Process: Section 1

The first section of B. The Mechanical Process that deals with the logical development of Mechanism is (a) The Formal Mechanical Process.

The section begins with the following: “The mechanical process is the positing of what is contained in the Notion of mechanism, and therefore, in the first instance, of a *contradiction*.” (Hegel, 1991, 716). The “concept” of Mechanism is the logical moment with which the section, A. The Mechanical Object finished. The `mechanical object` is now a negative unity: the negativity of having the identical determinateness to other mechanical objects whilst being indifferent to them. This is the contradiction with which A. The Mechanical Object concludes. This contradiction is now explored further in the (a) The Formal Mechanical Process. 

Above, Hegel writes that it is the “positing” of the contradiction in the `mechanical object` that gets the mechanical process started and it is worth dwelling on this for a moment. Hegel explains that by “positing” he means, 

>It follows from the Notion just indicated that the interaction of objects takes the form of the *positing* of the *identical* relation of the objects. This consists merely in giving to the determinateness that is determined, the form of *universality*; this is *communication*, which does not involve transition into an opposite (Hegel, 1991, 716)
Thus, the “positing” is an expression of the logical interaction of objects that relate to each other as identical. But where has this logical interaction come from? If we cast our minds back to the conclusion of A. The Mechanical Object we will recall that the contradiction was more specifically conceptualised as a negative unity. This negativity is the interaction of the `mechanical object` with another `mechanical object` – whereby a `mechanical object` has both an identical determinateness to another `mechanical object`, whilst being indifferent to it.

The negativity of the contradiction, then, logically unfolds as the positing of their identical determinateness. At this point, one might legitimately ask: why is the first positing that of their identity and not that of their indifference to each other? The answer must be: because it is their identity that binds them into a relation with one another. It is because they have an identical determinateness that there is a negative *unity* in the first place, and it is because of their identical determinateness that an interaction can take place. Thus, the identical relation is posited. 

The logical result of this positing is that the identical determinateness of the `mechanical objects` is itself determined. In other words, the logical structure of that identity is posited and in being posited is hardened (determined) into an actual moment between `mechanical objects`. Their identity is no longer just one side of a contradiction, but it has its day in the Sun, it is determined as a moment of what it is for the `mechanical object` to be in a formal mechanical relation with another `mechanical object`. 

Accordingly, because their identity is determined, their relation takes the form of a `universal`  –  there is nothing other than `mechanical objects` and these `mechanical objects` relate to each other as identical.[^1]: [first-paragraph](hegel/reference/mechanical-object/first-paragraph) Hegel calls this `communication` and, crucially, adds that it “does not involve transition into an opposite” (Hegel, 1991, 716). The `communication` between `mechanical objects` is a movement of identical determinations, and so strictly speaking, there is no change from one thing to something different. It is quite simply the identical determinateness that exists between `mechanical objects` – a kind of ether of determinateness that connects all objects together but does not affect them beyond connecting them.

### Communication Between Objects

Hegel then embarks on a remark that helpfully unpacks what he has in mind with the logical determination of `communication`. He writes:

>*Spiritual communication*, which moreover takes place in that element which is the universal in the form of universality, is explicitly an *ideal* relation in which *a determinateness continues* itself from one person into another unimpaired, and universalizes itself without any alteration whatever-as a scent freely spreads in the unresisting atmosphere. But even in communication between material objects, their determinateness *spreads*, so to speak, in a similarly ideal manner; personality is an infinitely more intense *impenetrability* [*Harte*] than objects possess (Hegel, 1991, 716).
The above paragraph provides a series of concrete instances of `communication`. Crucially, the examples given are all of the kind of communication that occurs between objects; Hegel makes the point to distinguish the kind of communication between objects to something like personality, which “is an infinitely more intense *impenetrability* [*Harte*] than objects possess” (Hegel, 1991, 716). This is an excellent opportunity to look closely at Hegel’s examples as they provide a window into how he thinks about the real-world instances of the logical development. If we spend a bit of time unpacking Hegel’s examples and scrutinising their validity, we will get a clearer understanding of how he thinks of ontology.

Beginning with Hegel’s first example, that of a scent diffusing in an atmosphere where there is no restriction on the diffusion of the scent. Why does Hegel think that this is a helpful example of how `communication` is exemplified in everyday life? At first glance, it makes sense. The way a scent freely diffuses itself around an atmosphere so that the whole atmosphere smells of the scent is reminiscent of the identical determinateness of the `mechanical object` that leads to it becoming a universal. However, how *exactly* are we supposed to understand this? Is the mechanical process at work between the scented molecules and the non-scented molecules, or is it just between the scented molecules? To pose this question is, I think, to overstep the conceptual restrictions of Mechanism and mechanistic thought. The distinction between a scented molecule and a non-scented molecule does not obtain within a mechanistic framework because, as `mechanical objects`, they do not have different determinations (*i.e.* one is scented and the other is non-scented). Quite simply, scented molecules and non-scented molecules have an identical determinateness.

### Interlude: How does the Science of Logic relate to External Reality?

A further philosophical conundrum poses itself. Above, I said that the distinction between a scented molecule and a non-scented molecule does not obtain within a mechanistic framework. This mode of thinking about how the logical determinations are reflected in everyday occurrences suggests that the same object can be thought of within a mechanistic framework, as well as other frameworks. Take the human body, one could conceive of it purely in mechanistic terms and theories of its processes in terms of cause and effect, or one could conceive of it in organicist terms and conceive of its processes differently. Now, what is crucial about this example is that it works because mechanistic thinking is more reductive than organicist thinking – the reverse would not be possible. One could not conceive of a rock within an organicist framework. Thus, the possibility of an object to be conceived within a plurality of frameworks requires that the object is open to reductionism. 

Now, a further thought. This does not mean that it is equally correct to conceive of the same object through the prism of multiple frameworks. The human body is an organic thing and so to conceive of it as a `mechanical object` is to misconstrue it. It *can* be done but you are failing to fully grasp what it is a for a human body to be what it is. Let us hold onto this reflection and turn back to the example of the diffusion of scent. Since we are within the realm of Mechanism, the simplest way that we have to conceive of the scented and the non-scented molecules is as `mechanical objects`[^2]: Of course, one could conceive of them as a `syllogism` or a `judgement`, but then they would cease to be conceived of as objects. Instead, they would be conceived of as concepts. It is plausible that one would have a more accurate conception of them through a chemical framework, as found in Chemism, which actually takes into account their different determinateness. But for now, they are `mechanical objects` whose determinateness is identical. 

### The Ideality of Communication

Returning to the text and progressing with it, Hegel writes that: “But even in communication between material objects, their determinateness spreads, so to speak, in a similarly ideal manner” (Hegel, 1991, 716). When talking about the diffusion of scent amongst molecules one might get the false impression that `communication` is the kind of process that only works with ideal, non-material objects. Now, It looks as if in Hegel’s time scent was thought to be transmitted in a non-material way. Obviously, this is no longer the case, but Hegel’s point is clear: `communication` is an ideal process that occurs between material objects. In other words, it is not just material processes that occur between material objects. Here, Hegel is clearly going against a materialist/mechanistic worldview whereby the only processes are *material* processes. Perhaps Hegel is thinking of forces and, perhaps more specifically, the force of gravity as an example of `communication`. 

At the end of this long paragraph where Hegel gives examples of `communication`, he expands on an important *logical* dimension of this moment. He writes:

>The formal totality of the object in general, which is indifferent to the determinateness and hence is not a self-determination, makes it undistinguished from the other object and thus renders the interaction primarily an unimpeded continuation of the determinateness of the one in the other (Hegel, 1991, 716)
`Communication` does not work simply because the determinateness between `mechanical objects` is identical but also because they are indifferent to determination. Their indifference means that the identical determinateness, in other words, the determinateness that is *communicated*, continues from one object to the other without any alteration in that determinateness. It just continues exactly as it did from the beginning. Thus, not only does `communication` begin from the identity of `mechanical objects` but it also continues with that identity throughout the interaction. 

Hegel, then, concludes this section on `communication` with an analysis of how it functions in the “spiritual sphere” (Hegel, 1991, 716). By spiritual sphere, Hegel has in mind the following: “Laws, morals, rational conceptions in general” (Hegel, 1991, 716). There are laws in a society, and these laws pervade (are communicated) throughout society without any obstruction or alteration. The same with morals, what a society takes to be right or wrong is immediately communicated throughout the society and, again, there is no alteration of morality (on a social level) as it goes from individual to individual.[^3]: Of course, this is based on an understanding of individuals within a society as mechanical objects that are part of mechanical processes. From this paragraph alone, it is not clear whether Hegel thinks that laws or morals are examples of `communication` or that he thinks that *they can be* used or expressed in the form of `communication`. I suspect that he thinks that the proliferation of laws, customs, etc, are logically structured according to `communication`. See: Nathan Ross.  Let us have a look at the first sentence of this paragraph to get a better understanding of what Hegel is going for:

>Now in the spiritual sphere there is an infinitely manifold content that is communicable; for being taken up into intelligence it receives this *form* of universality in which it becomes communicable. But the universal that is such not merely through the form but in and for itself, is the *objective* as such, both in the spiritual and in the material sphere; as against which the individuality of outer objects as well as of persons is an unessential element that can offer it no resistance (Hegel, 1991, 716).
### How Communication is different to Intelligence

The paragraph begins with an example that does not fall within the purview of `communication` because it is concerned with “intelligence” (Hegel, 1991, 716). Intelligence, then, does not fall within the logical remit of `Mechanism`. If we just focus on the text, however, it looks as if intelligence has the effect of giving the form of universality to a content and thereby making it communicable. There are 2 logical steps to clarify here: (1) intelligence takes on a manifold content and gives it the form of universality – a capacity that intelligence has, and (2) intelligence is able to communicate the content *because* it has the form of universality, *i.e.* a communicated content, whether it be through the `formal mechanical process` or through intelligence, must be universalised in order to be communicated.[^4]: It would be a fascinating thread of further research to explain exactly why intelligence has the capacity to give the form of universality to manifold content. I suspect that a good place to start for such an enquiry would be the ‘Philosophy of Spirit’.  

In contrast to intelligence, processes within the objective sphere, *i.e.* the `formal mechanical process` do not give to content the form of universality but are in-and-for-themselves universal. Why is this the case? The answer must have to do with the very beginning of `Mechanism` where the `mechanical object`. Hegel writes that “It is therefore in and for itself a universal -universality not in the sense of a community of properties, but a universality that pervades the particularity and in it is immediate individuality” (Hegel, 1991, 711). The reason why the objective, and by extension the `formal mechanical process` is in-and-for-itself the universal is because the difference between the determinations of `Concept` have been effaced.[^5]: See: [first-paragraph](hegel/reference/mechanical-object/first-paragraph). As such, by virtue of being in-and-for itself the universal, and not needing to give the form of universality to content, the `communication` of the `formal mechanical process` has the virtue of being unstoppable. As we said above, it quite simply pervades the entire spiritual and/or material sphere. The individuality of objects that encounter it does not come into consideration: the law, morality, etc, do no alter according to the individual but are universal. Whilst the content of an intelligence can be given the form of a universal, the fact that it is not in-and-for-itself a universal means that its content can be resisted, *i.e.* I am not automatically within the remit of Kant’s conception of the moral law just because it has the form of universality – my individuality has the power to resist. Not so with the `formal mechanical process` -- whilst I can resist against the law by breaking the law or protesting against the law, I am nevertheless automatically implicated within the law. My specific actions or my particular character does not have the power to pull me outside of its gravitational pull.
