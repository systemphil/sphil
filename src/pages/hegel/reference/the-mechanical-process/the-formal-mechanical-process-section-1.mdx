## (a) The Formal Mechanical Process: Section 1

The Mechanical Process in the Science of Logic consists of two headings: (a) The
Formal Mechanical Process and (b) The Real Mechanical Process. In this article,
I will deal with the first section of (a) The Formal Mechanical Process.

The section begins with the following: “The mechanical process is the positing
of what is contained in the Notion of mechanism, and therefore, in the first
instance, of a _contradiction_” (Hegel 1991, 716). The “concept” of Mechanism is
the logical moment with which the section, A. The Mechanical Object finished.
The `mechanical object` is now a negative unity: the negativity of having the
identical determinateness to other mechanical objects whilst being indifferent
to them. This is the contradiction with which A. The Mechanical Object
concludes. This contradiction is now explored further in the (a) The Formal
Mechanical Process.

Above, Hegel writes that it is the “positing” of the contradiction in the
`mechanical object` that gets the mechanical process started and it is worth
dwelling on this for a moment. Hegel explains that by “positing” he means,

> It follows from the Notion just indicated that the interaction of objects
> takes the form of the _positing_ of the _identical_ relation of the objects.
> This consists merely in giving to the determinateness that is determined, the
> form of _universality_; this is _communication_, which does not involve
> transition into an opposite (Hegel 1991, 716)

Thus, the “positing” is an expression of the logical interaction of objects that
relate to each other as identical. But where has this logical interaction come
from? If we cast our minds back to the conclusion of A. The Mechanical Object
[section-3](hegel/reference/mechanical-object/section-3) we will recall that the
contradiction was more specifically conceptualised as a negative unity. This
negativity is the interaction of the `mechanical object` with another
`mechanical object` – whereby a `mechanical object` has both an identical
determinateness to another `mechanical object`, whilst being indifferent to it.

The negativity of the contradiction, then, logically unfolds as the positing of
their identical determinateness. At this point, one might legitimately ask: why
is the first positing that of their identity and not that of their indifference
to each other? The answer must be: because it is their identity that binds them
into a relation with one another. It is because they have an identical
determinateness that there is a negative _unity_ in the first place, and it is
because of their identical determinateness that an interaction can take place.
Thus, the identical relation is posited.

The logical result of this positing is that the identical determinateness of the
`mechanical objects` is itself determined. In other words, the logical structure
of that identity is posited and in being posited is hardened (determined) into
an actual moment between `mechanical objects`. Their identity is no longer just
one side of a contradiction, but it has its day in the Sun, it is determined as
a moment of what it is for the `mechanical object` to be in a formal mechanical
relation with another `mechanical object`.

Accordingly, because their identity is determined, their relation takes the form
of a `universal` – there is nothing other than `mechanical objects` and these
`mechanical objects` relate to each other as identical.[^1] Hegel calls this
`communication` and, crucially, adds that it “does not involve transition into
an opposite” (Hegel 1991, 716).

The `communication` between `mechanical objects` is a movement of identical
determinations, and so strictly speaking, there is no change from one thing to
something different. It is quite simply the identical determinateness that
exists between `mechanical objects` – a kind of ether of determinateness that
connects all objects together but does not affect them beyond connecting them.

### Communication Between Objects

Hegel then embarks on a remark that helpfully unpacks what he has in mind with
the logical determination of `communication`. He writes:

> _Spiritual communication_, which moreover takes place in that element which is
> the universal in the form of universality, is explicitly an _ideal_ relation
> in which _a determinateness continues_ itself from one person into another
> unimpaired, and universalizes itself without any alteration whatever-as a
> scent freely spreads in the unresisting atmosphere. But even in communication
> between material objects, their determinateness _spreads_, so to speak, in a
> similarly ideal manner; personality is an infinitely more intense
> _impenetrability_ [*Harte*] than objects possess (Hegel 1991, 716).

The above paragraph provides a series of concrete instances of `communication`.
Crucially, the examples given are all of the kind of communication that occurs
between objects; Hegel makes the point to distinguish the kind of communication
between objects to something like personality, which “is an infinitely more
intense _impenetrability_ [*Harte*] than objects possess” (Hegel 1991, 716).
This is an excellent opportunity to look closely at Hegel’s examples as they
provide a window into how he thinks about the real-world instances of the
logical development. If we spend a bit of time unpacking Hegel’s examples and
scrutinising their validity, we will get a clearer understanding of
communication its its technical sense and ontological status.

Beginning with Hegel’s first example, that of a scent diffusing in an atmosphere
where there is no restriction on the diffusion of the scent. Why does Hegel
think that this is a helpful example of how `communication` is exemplified in
everyday life? At first glance, it makes sense. The way a scent freely diffuses
itself around an atmosphere so that the whole atmosphere smells of the scent is
reminiscent of the identical determinateness of the `mechanical object` that
leads to it becoming a universal. However, how _exactly_ are we supposed to
understand this? Is the mechanical process at work between the scented molecules
and the non-scented molecules, or is it just between the scented molecules? To
pose this question is, I think, to overstep the conceptual restrictions of
Mechanism and mechanistic thought. The distinction between a scented molecule
and a non-scented molecule does not obtain within a mechanistic framework
because, as `mechanical objects`, they do not have different determinations
(_i.e._ one is scented and the other is non-scented). Quite simply, scented
molecules and non-scented molecules have an identical determinateness.

What the above example provides us with, is a way of thinking about the abstract
logical structure of `communication` in a concrete way. The diffusion of the
scent is the unimpeded movement of the identical determinateness of
`mechanical objects` and the fact that a scent will diffuse throughout a room
and thus universalises itself within the room - in the sense that the scent can
be smelt throughout the room. As such, Hegel's account of `communication` gives
a philosophical explanation for why a scent diffuses through a room. Note, a
philosophical explanation does not seek to provide the material causes for why a
scent diffuses in a room. It explains what the (onto-)logical reasons for scent
diffusion are. These ontological reasons are: all of the particles in a room are
treated as the same, they are all `mechanical objects`; and the diffusion of the
scent, then, is explained by the fact that the particles share an identical
determinateness - they are identical.

A final note. This does not supplant a materialist explanation. Nor is it merely
a description of what is going on. The ontological reasons exist side-by-side
the materialist causes. The ontological reasons provide the conditions under
which the material causes can then find expression in the world. It is only
because particles or `mechanical objects` are identical to each other that the
diffusion of a scent in external reality can occur. Because, it is a
philosophical position to conceptualise all objects as identical - it is not
self-evident from the diversity of objects that we see around us.

### Interlude: How does the Science of Logic relate to External Reality? (Rokni)

A further philosophical conundrum poses itself. Above, I said that the
distinction between a scented molecule and a non-scented molecule does not
obtain within a mechanistic framework. This mode of thinking about how the
logical determinations are reflected in everyday occurrences suggests that the
same object can be thought of within a mechanistic framework, as well as other
frameworks. Take the human body,for example, one could conceive of it purely in
mechanistic terms and theorise of its processes in terms of cause and effect, or
one could conceive of it in organicist terms and conceive of its processes
differently. Now, what is crucial about this example is that it works because
mechanistic thinking is more reductive than organicist thinking – the reverse
would not be possible. One could not conceive of a rock within an organicist
framework. Thus, the possibility of an object to be conceived within a plurality
of frameworks requires that the object is open to reductionism.

Now, a further thought. This does not mean that it is equally correct to
conceive of the same object through the prism of multiple frameworks. The human
body is an organic thing and so to conceive of it as a `mechanical object` is to
misconstrue it. It _can_ be done but you are failing to fully grasp what it is a
for a human body to be what it is. Let us hold onto this reflection and turn
back to the example of the diffusion of scent. Since we are within the realm of
Mechanism, the simplest way that we have to conceive of the scented and the
non-scented molecules is as `mechanical objects`[^2].

[^2]:
    Of course, one could conceive of them as a `syllogism` or a `judgement`, but
    then they would cease to be conceived of as objects. Instead, they would be
    conceived of as concepts. It is plausible that one would have a more
    accurate conception of them through a chemical framework, as found in
    `Chemism`, which actually takes into account their different
    determinateness. But for now, they are `mechanical objects` whose
    determinateness is identical.

### The Ideality of Communication

Looking at the second half of the first paragraph of
`(a)The Formal Mechanical Process`, Hegel writes that: “But even in
communication between material objects, their determinateness spreads, so to
speak, in a similarly ideal manner” (Hegel 1991, 716). When talking about the
diffusion of scent amongst molecules one might get the false impression that
`communication` is the kind of process that only works with ideal, non-material
objects. Now, It looks as if in Hegel’s time scent was thought to be transmitted
in a non-material way. Obviously, this is no longer the case, but Hegel’s point
is clear: `communication` is an ideal process that occurs between material
objects. In other words, it is not just material processes that occur between
material objects. Here, Hegel is clearly going against a materialist/mechanistic
worldview whereby the only processes are _material_ processes. Perhaps Hegel is
thinking of forces and, perhaps more specifically, the force of gravity as an
example of `communication`.

At the end of this long paragraph where Hegel gives examples of `communication`,
he expands on an important _logical_ dimension of this moment. He writes:

> The formal totality of the object in general, which is indifferent to the
> determinateness and hence is not a self-determination, makes it
> undistinguished from the other object and thus renders the interaction
> primarily an unimpeded continuation of the determinateness of the one in the
> other (Hegel 1991, 716)

`Communication` does not work simply because the determinateness between
`mechanical objects` is identical but also because they are indifferent to
determination. Their indifference means that the identical determinateness, in
other words, the determinateness that is _communicated_, continues from one
object to the other without any alteration in that determinateness. It just
continues exactly as it did from the beginning. Thus, not only does
`communication` begin from the identity of `mechanical objects` but it also
continues with that identity throughout the interaction.

Hegel, then, concludes this section on `communication` with an analysis of how
it functions in the “spiritual sphere” (Hegel 1991, 716). By spiritual sphere,
Hegel has in mind the following: “Laws, morals, rational conceptions in general”
(Hegel 1991, 716). There are laws in a society, and these laws pervade (are
communicated) throughout society without any obstruction or alteration. The same
with morals, what a society takes to be right or wrong is immediately
communicated throughout the society and, again, there is no alteration of
morality (on a social level) as it goes from individual to individual.[^3]

[^3]:
    Of course, this is based on an understanding of individuals within a society
    as mechanical objects that are part of mechanical processes. From this
    paragraph alone, it is not clear whether Hegel thinks that laws or morals
    are examples of `communication` or that he thinks that _they can be_ used or
    expressed in the form of `communication`. I suspect that he thinks that the
    proliferation of laws, customs, etc, are logically structured according to
    `communication`. See: Ross, 2013.

### How Communication is different to Intelligence

Let us have a look at the first sentence of this paragraph to get a better
understanding of what Hegel is going for:

> Now in the spiritual sphere there is an infinitely manifold content that is
> communicable; for being taken up into intelligence it receives this _form_ of
> universality in which it becomes communicable. But the universal that is such
> not merely through the form but in and for itself, is the _objective_ as such,
> both in the spiritual and in the material sphere; as against which the
> individuality of outer objects as well as of persons is an unessential element
> that can offer it no resistance (Hegel 1991, 716).

The paragraph begins with an example that does not fall within the purview of
`communication` because it is concerned with “intelligence” (Hegel 1991, 716).
Intelligence, then, does not fall within the logical remit of Mechanism. If we
just focus on the text, however, intelligence has the effect of giving the form
of universality to a content and thereby making it communicable. There are 2
logical steps to clarify here: (1) intelligence takes on a manifold content and
gives it the form of universality – a capacity that intelligence has, and (2)
intelligence is able to communicate the content _because_ it has the form of
universality, _i.e._ a communicated content, whether it be through the
`formal mechanical process` or through intelligence, must be universalised in
order to be communicated.[^4]

[^4]:
    It would be a fascinating thread of further research to explain exactly why
    intelligence has the capacity to give the form of universality to manifold
    content. I suspect that a good place to start for such an enquiry would be
    the ‘Philosophy of Spirit’.

This is in stark contrast to the kind of universalisable content that an
intelligence can try to communicate. As we saw above, the content of an
intelligence can be given the form of a universal, but the fact that it is not
in-and-for-itself a universal means that its content can be resisted, i.e. I am
not automatically within the remit of Kant’s conception of the moral law just
because it has the form of universality – my individuality has the power to
resist. It is not the case with the `formal mechanical process' where resistance
is not even an option. On a mechanistic conception of society, i.e. where
citizens and political institutions are conceived of as mechanical objects that
participate within the formal mechanical processes, there is quite simply total
and an automatic acquiescence to the moral law and/or the law
