## Overview of Becoming

Being is the third category or determination of Hegel's _Science of Logic_. It
marks the beginning of explicit contradiction and logical instability in the
_Logic_. It also features the crucial idea of sublation [_Aufhebung_], which is
a term frequently used throughout of Hegel's philosophy.
