## Infinity

In Hegel's Science of Logic, the concept of infinity plays a crucial role in the dialectical development of being and nothing. Hegel distinguishes between "spurious infinity" (or "bad infinity") and "true infinity." Spurious infinity refers to an endless progression or alternation between finite things, such as an infinite series of numbers. True infinity, on the other hand, is a self-contained totality that encompasses both the finite and the infinite. For Hegel, true infinity is not something beyond the finite, but rather the process of self-relation and self-transcendence within the finite itself. As David Gray Carlson explains, "The true infinite is not the beyond of the finite, but the finite's own self-transcendence" (Carlson 2007, 86). This conception of infinity is central to Hegel's dialectical method and his understanding of the absolute.
