                    We&apos;ve been hard at work crafting this course, and
                    we&apos;re truly excited to share it with you. This is a
                    deep dive into one of the most profound works in philosophy,
                    and we couldn&apos;t be happier with what we have put
                    together. So without further ado:

                    </strong>{" "}
                    (part 1)‚Äîan in-depth course designed to guide you through
                    one of the most profound works in philosophy‚ÄîHegel&apos;s{" "}
                    <i>Science of Logic </i>. Over twelve weeks, you will
                    explore Hegel&apos;s dialectical method, uncover the
                    foundations of logic, metaphysics, epistemology and
                    ontology, and engage in rigorous discussions that will
                    challenge and expand your understanding of thought and
                    reality itself.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-500 my-4">
                    We will be examining closely Hegel&apos;s method of
                    presuppositionless thinking and interrogate the development
                    of the categories (or foundational ontological concepts)
                    like being, nothing, becoming, existence, quality,
                    something, other, being-for-other, being-in-itself,
                    determination, constitution and limit and every little
                    nuance between. Truly, we will mentally wrestle with the
                    philosopher!
