                    We will be examining closely Hegel&apos;s method of
                    presuppositionless thinking and interrogate the development
                    of the categories (or foundational ontological concepts)
                    like being, nothing, becoming, existence, quality,
                    something, other, being-for-other, being-in-itself,
                    determination, constitution and limit and every little
                    nuance between. Truly, we will scale the mountain of the
                    ontological concepts!
