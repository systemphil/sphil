 * In order for Card to animate the pseudo-background, it must access certain CSS properties exposed via the Houdini API,
 * which is not available(?) in TailwindCSS.
 * Therefore, a special CSS class "card-magic" was made to achieve this. This class only does the fancy animation
 * styling, leaving the rest, such as size and background, to be handled by Tailwind as per usual.
 * @See {@Link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/articles/Web/Guide/Houdini CSS Houdini}
