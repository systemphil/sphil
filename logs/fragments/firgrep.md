# Ref Systemic Presuppositions

Explore constraints.

Difference-generation is creative, much like the concept. Moment of
particularization?

Explain better the short-circuiting?

Is a dialectic is developed prior to the dialectic of the logic. But how can
that be? How can there be a beginning if it has already begun?

(Pure being is itself beginning-less; internally it neither begins nor ends. We
as thinkers "begin" to think being. But how does this not entail a split in the
mind? We think the category but also think around it, or think that we think
it.)

- Is Hegel's response to the conundrum a matter of "philosophical training" or
  is there a verification, logical or linguistic, that one can perform on the
  content? Or would Hegel simply come back at us and point out that we are once
  again presupposing some category that is doing our work?
- Identity of form and content force the focus on to the thinking itself not
  merely what is thought, so it must also incorporate _how_ that thinking is
  developed.
- In addition, there is the how of form and content itself, how this is
  motivated.
