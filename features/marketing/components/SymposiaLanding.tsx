                    text="We dream of a way of doing philosophy that is intense, life-long and free. To be able to rigorously engage with concepts and ideas to their utmost depth without sacrificing either scholarly quality or creativity. To be able to pursue and hone one's philosophical craft and enjoyment in a way that supports and enriches everyday living. And finally to be thinking deeply about contents of philosophy purely for their own sake. Symposia exists as a companion to sPhil, a collaborative encyclopaedia inspired by systematic philosophers and modern open source principles. Symposia is intended to be an additional guide into the philosophical resources we otherwise make freely available at sPhil. Whether you are a novice or a professional, our courses welcome anyone who has a burning desire to examine, philosophically, the wonders of being."

The title of his thesis was Hegel's Critique of Determinism: Justifying Unfreedom as a Moment of Freedom. Filip has given papers and organized numerous conferences on philosophy. He has taught extensively both at university, at the Halkyon Academy and privately. Filip's main research areas are systematic philosophy, metaphysics, ontology, essence, freedom, determinism, and maintains an otherwise broad interest in all the dimensions of intelligence and reason. Filip is also an incurable fan of the art and poetry of William Blake."
